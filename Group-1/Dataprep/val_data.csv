13374,"what has effectively drained the life out of my soul the quickest, is the fact that everything revolves around money. nobody is motivated by anything else. if you are really sick and do not have insurance, you are pretty much signing yourself up for a life of extreme debt.if.you choose to go to the hospital. even with insurance, the same thing can happen, but on a smaller scale. my dad had a heart attack and had decent insurance, but he still owed 60,000 after he got out of the hospital and then he had to work three jobs to stay out of bankruptcy. he worked like a dog until he was 80 and lost his sight. for decades, he had a much weaker heart, but was having to work three times harder to keep his head above water financially. also.therapy is exceedingly expensive. my oldest sister has spent roughly 20,000 on therapy over the years and.honestly.she is not any better and in some ways she is much worse. even if the therapy was somewhat beneficial, the weight of the debt you owe counteracts any good that might have come from the process. i went to a place called.5 palms.in florida. i admitted myself and was there for an intensive emotional rehab course that was supposed to last a month. well.the insurance stated that they were only going to cover 2weeks. so.i left after 2 weeks and thought that was the end of it. however, they lied to me when they said that all i needed to pay was 3,000 up front and the insurance would cover the rest. after i got back and started feeling better, they sent me a very unexpected additional fee of over 6,000. immediately, i went into a panic and all the initial benefit and healing that i received from 5 palms completely vanished. actually.because of that huge additional bill, i was worse off emotionally than when i went in. i was so stressed out because now i owed over 6,000 and i had previously given them 3,000 in the beginning.that was a surprise and was not shared with me until i was already back home. i felt used and abused. i felt preyed on, as a person that desperately needed mental health support. they took advantage of me. they truly did not care about me. they only wanted to push me through the system like a cattle drive and reap the revenue from screwing me over. yet another helpless person. if you do not have money, you cannot eat. you cannot have a decent roof over your head and unfortunately, if you want to have a real chance of being loved, you absolutely have to have your finances in order or nobody will want anything to do with you. in order to be respected, you need money. if you want health emotional or physical, you need money. if you want good nutrition, you need money. the list is endless. even if you ask someone to help you move, they want payment of some kind money, beer, pizza.etc. they never want to help you out of the goodness of their heart. if you do not have a way to compensate them, they just come up with excuse after excuse as to why they are not available. unfortunately, you grow up in a world that teaches you that you personally are worthless as a human being unless you have money. that is the subliminal brain washing tactic.that eats away at your soul and before long, you are extremely depressed and feel so low about yourself. you become worthless, unwanted and very lonely. all because you do not worship money.the masses are fooled by this mindset and it really only benefits the top 1 of americans anyway we are all mindless cattle under the finger of the mega rich. if you do succumb to the deceitful thought process, that money is a god of sorts, then you might be able to do more things and seemingly have more fun, but deep down you are slaving away for cash, as your only means of self worth, and you just feel like a machine. money only gives you false security and fake friends.and you know that deep inside. you work extra hard for more ways to entertain yourself and keep your mind occupied. so.whether you have money or not, it is a double edged sword. if you do not have it, you are lost.and.if you do have it and your not in the 1 club, you are lost.but yet everyone is clambering to get their hands on more and more of it. millions of people die in wars, murder, hunger and even endure human trafficing because someone wants money and will do absolutely anything to get it. the mind is a very peculiar thing. it will devise ways to covertly try and avoid the catastrophic things that are right in your face and dim the brilliance of the red flags flying all around you for mere survival sake. you begin to play mind games with yourself just to barely function. i feel like neo, in the original matrix movie. i took the red pill and the vale has been lifted on society for what it really is. i absolutely despise money. i hate it so much. i would burn all of it, if it was within my power. there needs to be a better way. society has been brainwashed for centuries and this is just how life is now. money rules everything. people will totally sell their soul for it because it has become the only focal point on the horizon. they will spend all their time working at the office and let their children raise themselves or allow them to be raised by other means.tv, internet, movies.etc. society is so screwed up and we all know it. we cannot look it straight in the face and fully admit how bad it is. it is very similar to death denial. everyone knows they are going to die someday, but cannot truly admit that. coming face to face with the fact that you are going to die.without a doubt.is mentally traumatizing. the same goes with the way society is now. we all know that it is extremely screwed up and beyond recovery. however, we cannot fully admit that because it would be too mentally traumatizing. thanks for

34280,"freaking out about dvt! hi all. i literally just found this reddit 20 minutes and, im already. extremely thankful for it, i've suffered with bouts of health anxiety on and off for years and its been one of the most soul crushing things to experience in my life. lately since i got a big job my anxiety has latched back to my health again because it constantly needs to focus on something with me. i'm a massive worrier in general, its terrible but im trying my best all the time. a few months ago it hyper fixated on blood clots on my legs and dvt thus causing like intense leg pains and what not i think after months of just fixating on it and also developing a real actual flu that was debilitating and not from my hell brain i just wore it out of my brain which is cool i guess. except not really because i've recently developed a lump in my neck most likely frm flu. its painless goes from feeling tender to firm but it swims around a little on my neck and goes from unnoticeable to like really noticeable. what has me freaking out though is that its on top of an artery, we went to the er after i had one really bad freak out and managed to at least get a nurse to check it we would have stuck around for the doctor but it was like 1am and we would have had to wait til like 5 am. also my mom kind of started giving me flack on all of this bc she's extremely impatient on my hypochondria and really horrible about it who took my blood pressure and kinda felt it , she assumes its a lymph node and i know a nurse isnt a doctor but im trying my best to be rational in that ok maybe she is right because nurses do experience a lot of shit with patients and should be pretty well versed on things. but idk its been like 2 weeks and its still there and my brain is just. in literal hell . im just freaking out that every day is my last and i just have clot hanging out there even though its like painless and not red or like super hot to touch and in like like the next 20 minutes i mgonna just endure a stroke or something and my brain is fried enough as is so im not even processing thoughts properly or anything. also w hypochondria since im like still googling shit on what it may be! im starting to endure what im assuming is sensations im making up like pains in my neck whatever. but im also like paranoid that im actually right on all of this because this is the most real physical thing ive experienced i guess with my hypochondria. also ive seen some stuff with swollen things in necks with cancer and at this point im just trying to not even look into that because i think i'll literally have another break down, im sorry i guess, i just needed to vent somewhere where others would get what im experiencing because at home its been very much condescending and dismissive and i feel extremely trapped and upset. i'd love to go back to the doctors again myself but i have really bad agoraphobia as well and due to how condescending my folks have been with me i feel extremely embarrassedashamedupset on any of my emotions on all of this and how much im fixating. its just really scary and im just really sad at this point. anyway thank you for reading this if you do and being patient with me if you respond",Anxiety

24032,"sorry if this whole post is a mess, my mind is a huge mess atm anybody out there who grew up without proper adult supervision or is currently doing so? man, if you are, i have deep respect for you and you deserve nothing but the best in life. i live this way too and it is the worst. i am currently 15 years old and i have been living without proper adult supervision for nearly 3 years. people might think living with no house rules, no discipline, no anything might be the best, but it is nothing like that for me. basically, i live with a lazy cousin who does almost nothing else but play games and shit even though he is 22. and my guardians who are supposed to be taking care of me are miles away from the house i live in. for the past couple of years, i have been raising my own self aside from financial support which i am thankful for but it is not enough, pretty much trying to figure everything out all alone. before this all happened to me, i had a pretty normal life, wherein i was kind of dependent on my parents on everything. but i mean, c'mon, parents are there to give children what they need time, love, and their basic needs, you know. so moving onto this kind of lifestyle after i lost my parents was really tough. i had to deal with mourning their loss, moving into a new city, school, home, changing my lifestyle completely, and leaving my friends, my old house all behind altogether. and i was pretty much alone throughout all of it because nobody my age could understand how i felt, and my guardians who are supposed to be looking out for me kind of always just leave me alone. sure, it might not be the hardest thing ever for some people, but it really has been for me. fast forward to nearly 3 years of living this kind of life, it is only gotten worse. the house i live in is always under heavy neglect because of my failure to keep up with all the chores, and my cousin literally not helping but just adding to the mess. the dishes always pile up, we seldomly take out the trash so that piles up too, there are so many containers in the fridge with unfinished food that has been there for several months, the back area is infested with insects and snails, parts of our rooves are leaking, our gardens are ridiculously overgrown and were always late on restocking groceries, etc. i could keep going on and it just gets worse and worse. to add to that, we do not eat healthy foods and only eat 12 times a day, we just eat processed foods or fast foods, plus we do not get any exercise either. our lives are disgusting, and i really wish i had the strength to persevere and change our lives but. it is been so tough being in all of this alone. i always try to initiate changing our lives, but every time i do so, hoping i would motivate my cousin to help me, he does not help me. he still stays lazy while i try and fix our lives and it really takes a huge toll on me and always affects my progress because i just wish he would help. lately, i have been dealing with so much more to the point i have nearly attempted to leave the world for good several times. i thought, i just rather be with my mom now. this is because my aunt who lives halfway across the world decided that i was going to get two puppies. do not get me wrong, i love dogs so much, but they are not suitable for the kind of lifestyle i have right now. and now i feel so overwhelmed with how untidy and messy our house is, but the dogs are already here. i feel so bad for them, i feel like they deserve a much better home. and it is also been a struggle to take care of them personally. because i feel like i am failing them and not providing everything they need. they are both big breed dogs, which i have never had so everything with them is a new experience for me. i feel like i am not giving them the proper lifestyle they need so it is been so stressful. plus, again, as expected, my cousin is not helping. he does not even at least pet them or play with them, you know? and it hurts me so much. i live in a middle to upperclass town but my life is pretty close to how people in poverty live or even worse, because at least some of them still manage to have fun and have loving families. this place is the most depressing place i have ever seen and lately, i have just realized how emotionally neglected i am. it is been nearly 3 years since my mom passed away but i have not even gotten close to moving on. the thought of her being gone has been and still is so heartbreaking and always brings me to tears. and nobody in my family has bothered to sit down with me and ask me how i am doing or how i am coping. it is just been so dead in the house i live in, especially for the past year and a half in quarantine. my cousin and i barely talk unless we go outside to run errands. he just stays in his room all day and does not bother helping out with the house. i swear to god, i have contemplated just going away for good so many times. this fucking life is horrible and i want to escape so badly and be with my mom in heaven. the only thing that is stopping me now are my dogs, i love them too much now to leave them behind knowing that they might not be taken care of properly. so i really am trying my best to muster up the strength to fix my life, without the feeling of needing my cousin to be as productive as me. but i just find it so hard, depression just does that to you, i guess. i just wish things get better and i wish i continue to fight for myself and my dogs. ps. i am not really looking for pity, we all have our own tough challenges in our lives, and this is my battle to fight. i would absolutely appreciate it though if those with the same experiences comment down below and let me know how you managed to get out of it and get better. or at least what you do to cope. i am 15, and i have been realizing how emotionally neglected i'am by my family.",Depression

18692,"i have never gone in to be diagnosed, so i do not want to jump the gun on labels or anything, but i have had quite the wild ride with depression throughout a good chunk of my life and i am at the point where i feel like i am truly standing on the edge. not the edge of suicide. rather, the edge of being able to put things off or make excuses.to give more context and a bit of a timeline, even as a young kid i would have weird moments of clarity where i would just feel at a complete disconnect with peers, as if i just did not have a place with them or if i was a useless part of the equation. when i was twelve was when i started having onandoff feelings of inadequacy, and by thirteen i would have thoughts of suicide. i say thoughts in general because it was fantasizing scenarios more than anything. i did not take the thoughts seriously until around 1516. once i was sixteen i would essentially start planning on actually killing myself however, over the next few years, i would constantly move the goalpost due to either feeling a string of hope, or rather the goalpost may have just been there to give me an excuse to put things off and be lazy. it was around 16 when feelings of disconnect and uselessness really settled in. over the years, it is obviously just been made worse, and i have dug myself a deeper hole. really, i just cannot do anything and my brain as well as my body feel like mush most of the time. i hesitate to contact friends because i should not be the one bothering them. i hate myself for being a burden on my family, and for getting involved with others because i just cannot add anything good to their lives, and i do not get anything but shame in return either. i am 21 now and have never gotten 'help' for any of this. before it was easier to deal with. if i was still in college taking my course, or at least working my part time job at the time, then it would not matter. i would not feel as guilty because at least i was on what some may figure is a 'right track'. now all i can feel is shame and guilt over just existing here, and even the things i have managed to do to help myself over the last couple years have not exactly made me feel any better, or improved the lives of those involved with me.that is not all because i am so stationary and lonesome all the time, i can get really desperate when opportunities arise. things come and go so easily, but i tend to get attached just as easy. if people come into my life and make me feel good for a bit before leaving, that just leaves me worse off than before and i feel like i am struggling to even hit mediocrity. i do not blame peoplethings for not working out with me because i know all i can really offer is a netnegative experience, but i cannot help myself from being blinded with a brief sense of hope every time.as the title suggests, i do not know where to go from here. the last point i have made happened again recently, and now i am in a spot where it is just been hard to get things done because i am in a state of not only 'what is the point?', but also 'i just do not care anymore'. i do not even have any more 'goalposts' to give me any excuses to just live comfortably for a bit. the last one was going to be a couple days after christmas of 2020, but again, nothing happened.i am now at a point where i am willing to try meds. just between the usual, constant feelings of guilt and worthlessness and feeling incapable of things some new events that have unfolded recently i do not think it is worth it not to try if i can make myself better. i was recently prescribed other meds already, and i actually found out that my province covers this stuff until i reach 24 years old, which is good news. to be quite honest, i am just scared because i do not want anyone i am close to, to know about this. i know that the obvious response will just be to worry about me, and i really do not want that. not really sure how to proceed from here",Depression

what the fuck do you expect me to do what the fuck is wrong with you now? and so i keep it all down, i suppress it, and i feel physically awful all the time. chronic migraines, i never get a break where my mind is not trying to distract itself or is not in an existential dread or downfall. it is not worth living like this, even as much as i love my pets and partner and family. i do not want to leave them but i feel i have to. i wish it was like the romanticized versions of mental health issues. where your partner holds you and tells you it will be okay, instead of the reality of your partner getting stressed and cracking every now and then and yelling and making it worse and saying hurtful things that come back around the next time, no matter how hard you try to forget it. when i get like that, being held and told it is going to be okay sounds like something otherworldly and heavenly and amazing. i really want to end it all, especially knowing that i will never have that. i have had that maybe a few times, and only after being torn down, only after the person who has the misfortune of seeing me like that calms down. even then, they never learn a better way to handle it, or listen to me or care to remember when i try to get out what i need and how to handle the situation i say what my therapist has told me to tell others, it does not work because i guess they all forget. it is a cycle of pain, relief at last, and then forget. then repeat. constantly. and i am too weak to handle it. there is good reason for me living. i know if i passed many would miss me greatly and my pets would likely be confused or miss me as well. i do not want that to happen, i suppose, but i want to end this constant suffering and that seems like a small price to pay. though i also do love being sentient and conscious, i love listening and seeing and hearing new things. i love learning, and in this world and universe there is so much to learn, i could spend a lifetime doing so, even though i may not have access to formal higher education i have a phone and access to videos, lectures, news and studies. that might be worth sticking around for, but i only love it so much because it is a distraction from my deeper troubles. so why dwell in it and continue the distraction? even when i write this stuff, it makes me cry hard because towards the end i realize how much i enjoy life and living, and i realize how hard and near incapable i am of doing so fully. it makes me feel shattered and bleak. why even write it at all?it feels like i cannot even trust my own brain anymore. i already cannot trust it. why even go on if i cannot trust my own brain?

'a miracle indeed', means i was unexpected. when i was 10, he bought me some trousers. they were bigsized. the cashier told him i do not need such a big size. yes, i was somehow overweight. like, 5 or maybe 10 kilograms more than i should have had. i liked food, i still do. like, tasting food is the only thing that makes me feel good. anyway, he bought the trousers anyway after telling the cashier she is fat. we got home and guess what. the stupid trousers were indeed very big for me. and when i told him that he raised his voice telling me 'you are fat, understand that already!'. i think this fucked my selfesteem so hard. i have social anxiety and i cannot go outside. i am afraid, i hope the next university year will be online again. he hit me from times to times. he told me once to buy something from a specific shop and i bought from another because i forgot. he hit my leg. he hit me many times when he found out i started smoking ciggs. 16 years old and my mom allowed it because she was the one finding me smoking and thought they were right. my dad said something like she will become a whore eventually. just because i smoked. like almost every teenager. i remembered this part of my childhood because they are fighting now. they kept yelling at each other 'go to hell' and swear words that i cannot translate to english. they are so uneducated and my mom is obsessed with church. she told me that a priest think we will have a war on august. she keeps telling me that people are stupid and do not know what is coming. i just feel like if i had other parents and a decent life i would have been somebody by now, you know? maybe i would have had a summer job i had 3 and they fucked my self esteem even more maybe i would have had a boyfriend, a group of friends. i do not understand how girls can undress in front if someone. i cannot even imagine. i am so embarrased with myself. i am a virgin and i feel like a failure. who would want such an unexperienced girlfriend? no one loves me and i love nobody. sometimes i make myself think that i love someone, that i care about someone but that is my imagination. being poor is not embarrasing my mom tells me. no, but i am still embarrased with how things did not work for me just because you are who you are. if you read all this shit, thanks. i have no one that i can go to. writing a part of my childhood trauma. long shit. i know you are not going to read. i will pretend this is my diary.",Suicidal

34318,"my silly panic attack last night i'm sharing this panic attack story because i feel it represents health anxiety and might help you all to cope with physical symptoms. this might be a little long. i had had a stressful day at work and had also done an anxiety nono and googled my irregular period symptoms i have been having recently. needless to say this all made me panicky by the evening. when i got home i vented to my husband, smoked some high cbd low thc cannabis and worked out for an hour hoping that would calm me. it worked for the most part until bedtime. i was laying in bed surfing the interwebs before i fell asleep when it happened. a weird physical sensation. felt like my throat went numb. now i had experienced this symptom before about a year ago and at that moment i had forgotten about that. a year ago i had a full neurological check up including an mri. of course all results were negative and i was fine. in the moment though i couldn't remember that. so i started to get nervous. is it a stroke or seizure? is my throat closing in anaphylactic shock? i had to check to be sure. so i shove my my finger into the back of my throat feeling around. i'm pushing in really far and playing with my uvula. i can feel everything. good okay. throat's not numb. but wait, why am i not gagging? thats weird. my finger's digging in but i'm not gagging at all. i think you all can guess what i did next, right? yup, i googled it. what came up was horrifying. the worst results i have ever seen from googling symptoms. then bam! heart starts racing, my face goes numb and i start to shake uncontrollably. i start calling my husband's name telling him i think he should call 911. luckily i recognize the shaking and racing heart as a panic attack and not a part of the symptoms mentioned on google. my husband was a champ! he got me started on deep breathing and began to comfort me. i started to calm the panic attack pretty quickly but what i saw on google still screamed in my head. i wondered if i could wait to go to urgent care in the morning or if i really should go to the er now. i always worry about the boy who cried wolf kinda symptoms. like i keep getting weird symptoms and it's always nothing but the one time i should have gone to the er i ignored it instead. i'm sure we've all been there. i explain to my husband what triggered the panic attack and he insists i'm fine. its at this point i remember i've had the numb throat feeling before and had negative mri results. but i had never stuck my finger down my throat. maybe if they had known i couldn't gag they would have done another test or know other symptoms to diagnose me. as my panic attack subsided i got up to use the bathroom. away from my husband i tried to make myself gag with my finger again. nothing. next, however, i jammed my toothbrush down my throat and gag! oh sweet relief! i can gag! turns out, after testing it out, i can't gag myself with my own finger. or at least it's really hard to. i had jumped to conclusions because, well, how often does a person try to gag themself with their finger? i think a lot of our symptoms are like this. we become so sensitized and aware of our bodies we notice things we never paid attention to before and then freak out fearing the worst, or googling it. these are really just normal body sensations that most people are able to ignore or not even feel. i should have kept the fact i had a rough day in the back of my mind and taken a minute or two after i had noticed the first symptom to see if it went away by distracting myself. and never ever ever google a symptom! never! i know we know this, and i know how hard it is not to, but don't, and don't body check your symptoms either. distract or truly objectively analyze your symptoms. more often than not they will go away or not be nearly as strong as they first felt. this was my first panic attack in over a year and i'm not letting it get me down. it has reassured me that while uncomfortable, panic attacks aren't dangerous. it also allows me to recognize my symptoms of stress leading up to an attack so next time i can perform more stringent selfcare before it snowballs into an attack. these moments are only making it easier for me to recover from anxiety, not making it worse. stay strong everyone!",Anxiety

52313,"i'm hesitant to get a diagnosis so, i've reached the point when i amassed enough courage to ask for an appointment with a psychiatrist. i've done therapy for about 5 years and never was brave enough to ask my therapist if i had either anxiety or depression. but 5 months ago i started with chronic tensional headaches finished college and found two jobs, ended up very stressed, which i controlled after a neurologist prescribed me pregabalin. however, i've been struggling with other somatic symptoms that lead me to say, okay you waited too much, it's time to do it. even though i hate the idea of being that selfdiagnose person, i've been doing a lot of reflection and truly believe i have several symptoms of anxiety, perhaps social or general anxiety. i will be seeing this doc who was very recommended to me, and i fear judgment but much much more fear is if i get prescribed meds that mess me up worse. i know she's an outstanding professional, she has appropiately medicated my bf's niece for anxiety, and honestly doubt i'd need something strong but i'm so scared of start taking meds, i fear there's no turning back from it. i fear it changes me so badly that i have bad moments at my job in front of everyone, like crying or a panic attack, or that i make an embarrassment. i don't want to lose my job since it there are two but the full time one has helped me to get out of my lifeless and procrastination days. haven't seen my therapist lately since she had a temporary license and now i'm also unsure if i should come back because she never made me a diagnosis. my general doctor told me to come back to therapy asap. sorry for the long post i'd like to know if someone relates to this or your experiences, but mostly if you know about meds and if i'm just panicking too much or maybe i just need to know this before meeting the psychiatrist.",Anxiety

13650,"hi everyone. this is going to be a different post from my prior two. feel free to read about why i am going to end my life in a few months in my prior posts if you want to. here are some of my hopes for the future after i am gone. i am an old millennial. i am as old as you can be and still be a millennial. i have witnessed firsthand how millennials and younger have had to deal with horrible recessions and wages not keeping pace with inflation. home ownership is also now becoming an impossibility without being dangerously close to bankruptcy even if you can afford to save a down payment while working a job that barely pays the rent. i am in finance and do ok financially, but grew up poor and have had struggles. my first real job paid enough to have a nice one bedroom apartment in a great neighborhood and now that same entry level job would barely keep a crappy roof over my head. life is unfortunately getting harder, but it does not have to be this way. i am encouraged by the labor shortage and the remote working revolution. let us just call the labor shortage for what it really is. it is a bunch of companies not paying a living wage and then complaining that they cannot find people to work. all jobs in the united states should pay a living wage, period. if their business model does not support a living wage, they need to go out of business. please continue to fight the good fight and resist these crappy companies and jobs. they will only change if they are forced to change. if you are fortunate enough to have a job that can be done remotely, resist the employers push to return to the office. either demand more money for the extra time and commute or quit for a remote job. they want control over you. millions of us proved for over a year and a half that the company can make money, we can be productive and have more time for us. to be able to live anywhere we want. to have more freedom. now, they want to return to the old ways to control you. resist it. understand that you have value. a good employer should treat you like you are in a mutually beneficial relationship. again, companies will revert back to the old ways and force us into long commutes, time away from family and force us to live somewhere we do not want to live if you allow them to get away with it. punish their bottomline by resigning in massive waves until they get the message. forcing me back into the office was the final nail in my coffin. do not allow them to get away with taking even more of your freedom. having a living wage, a nice roof over your head and more freedom does not guarantee happinesses as i have experienced, but i also know it is damn near impossible to have happiness if your basic needs are not met. i am also encouraged that social acceptance around depression seems to be increasing. i have noticed more people publically talk about their problems even in the workplace. yes, we have a long way to go but the trend is encouraging. i really am encouraged by younger people questioning the status quo. i just hope they win and make the world a slightly better place. it will not resolve all problems. for example, it would not do anything to cure my loneliness, but financial problems and struggle are one of the leading causes of depression. the younger generation has an opportunity to improve the way things are. good luck to all of you. i truly hope you find peace and happiness. i do not have anyone to talk to in my life and reddit has been one small pleasure during my time of extreme unhappiness. thank you all. general advice to people and some trends that i hope will continue after i am gone",Suicidal

11100,"hello everyone! i just want to put a disclaimer that i am poor right now and i cannot afford therapy or even just the medicine alone.i grew out of wedlock and after a year of marriage, they had annulled their marriage because divorce is impossible here. i am barely hanging on a thread right now despite being currently semistable. so, i grew up to be extremely neglected by my parents, having no emotional support and it was really tough because i could not cry in front of my mom as it was considered weak. i would like to say that we are decently close because i came out as gay to her and my family included, but she is not really the type to give any emotional affection especially now that i am older. i have not heard any i love yous from both of my parents and they cannot tell me directly how they are feeling and that i have the same situation. we do not communicate at all and i am already 18 so i do not absolutely know what it is like to be loved through affirmations and physical affection. currently, both of them have their own separate families and i am staying with my mom, but of course, i am living near poverty. it sucks because i have not really felt what family is nor do i feel belonged because most of the time it is forced interactions. my father messaged me that he was sorry, but he is not really because he just happened to know what was happening to me. if he was sorry, then he would have been at the start. there is too many information i could say, but know that i was emotionally neglected by both of my parents because they were too busy, too selfish, and too complacent.anyway, i just wanted to know if it is normal to feel and say to myself these words while growing up i want to die? it probably started on elementary when i was constantly bullied both physically and emotionally by my classmates and i remember trying to open up to my mother. i downplayed every problem i faced to my mom because she would often say how she is filled with problems, so naturally i had to talk to her in a nonworrying and nonstressful manner. she said to just be strong and fight back, and i did. for many years, i pointed a knife on my chest and wanted to stab myself with it many times at that age. but, i eventually moved on from that because i stood up for myself. it did lessen, but to my female classmate, it got worse.moving on to 7th grade, i transferred and of course i was again on the center of ridicule with somehow showcasing slightly feminine behaviors. it was stupid, but i was made fun of, though i ignored it because i was better than them. i was intelligent i was better than most of the kids at my age, however, i knew that i was going to be ridiculed always and such thoughts came back.moving on to 8th grade where i transferred again because we moved places again, i was in a new environment. a more competitive environment whose friend groups and cliques have already formed and stabilized. i was basically an outcast in a block section of 40 students. i was terrified of crowds, i would often get nervous when conversing to other people, but that was fixed by myself when i joined rotc for high school. anyway, with me being an outcast and people avoiding me because they already have their own friends and also me having a quirky personality, i often spent my time alone or trying my best to sit with others. since, i felt so deprived of friendship and bonds, i subconsciously wrote i want to die again in a piece of paper because that is what i felt and i never talked about it to my mother, even up until now.9th grade came and i was raped by my uncle. i was scared and scarred, mainly because i thought i was going to contract any virus. i attempted to ask help from my mom, but i downplayed it again to just a dream and mentioned it was vague. i was afraid of putting someone in jail, afraid of what others will think of me, and afraid of what will happen in the future. up to this day, i am still frightened by the thought and image of him, but i already have moved on from the nightmare. i cried many nights because i still did not have any close friends and i was always called weird. 10th grade was a bit better and more tolerable and i ranked 2nd on the whole batch. this was the time, before i transferred again to 11th grade, i hooked up with someone from grindr. it was mainly a onetime thing, but then when i reached 11th grade and moved to a morepopulated area, i found myself using that app many times to seek comfort, connections, and distractions to my problems. this was the time i recognized my mental health was worsening even more. i attempted to jump off a building twice, but failed. first was i talked myself out of it and the second was i slipped backwards and broke down. or so i like to tell myself. i made those two scenarios up because that would at least have a more viable scenario for my situation. truth is, i am scared of pain and being shouted to at. i fear being left out when people come in my life. it is what it is, but i am damaged. i mentioned to my mom i was suicidal, but she also said that she is suicidal and i should deal with my thing.12th grade and graduation came and until now, i realized a lot of things. i know who to blame for damaging and scarring me and i have been trying my best to cope. again, there were so many scares that i dealt with hivscare i am negative, but when you gain enlightenment, it is just dragging you even more down to the abyss. all the nights i cried and had panic attacks, all the unnecessary selfhate by hooking up and trying to od myself, and all the negative suicidal thoughts in my head right now are all present in my head clashing.right now, death is the closest comfort i have because i cannot handle these emotions and thoughts anymore. i feel suffocated, trapped in my own hell. i do not want to be abandoned i want to be loved and to be hugged, and be said that i matter to the people i care and think about. i think i might just take my life sooner or later. i made a promise to myself to kill myself in two years if i do not find a constant source of happiness and i feel as if things are being faster and now i just want to remove the mountain on my back and finally feel peace through death. i just want to be loved, but it seems comfort and eternal peace is my only option right now. i do not want to be invalidated that those are not my options because 1 i am poor, 2 my parents and i do not communicate about our feelings and experiences, and 3 death is a permanent solution to my permanent problems. i have been suicidal since i was really young",Suicidal

13397,"to start, i am here because of relationship anxiety. i had posted recently about having immense anxiety about a girl i barely knew. awesome girl. very grounded, very sweet. but for some odd reason, chemistry somewhere down the way i had become infatuated rather quick. and then a certain unease crept in that felt like i was screwing up somewhere. within moments i automatically jumped to very negative affirmations that swirled in my head, day and night for the past two weeks. the ones that stick out you are going to fuck this up, you are not normal, she will find out your issues and dip from yo crazy ass!somewhere down the way, i deeply pondered at the last part. life looking back was rather well.childhood!i had parents who had issues in their relationship on their own, let own their own individual demons. i acknowledge that they always did their best to make sure we were fed and had a roof over our heads. but a lot of things i felt i had to teach myself on my own. in the beginning life was okay, but after awhile it got tough for my parents way back. and certain choices were made then that led to exodus from hawaii to the mainland. things were the best we could make but they were not ideal. at some point in time, we slept in a car as a family.we never stayed in one place for longer than a year. always constantly moving since i was a kid, it practically never ended until i had gotten a place of my own. it did not with my parents anger issues, mother's narcissism, and my father's drinking and abuse. still through it all, they stuck it out for us, but i wonder sometimes if that was a good idea.when both of my younger siblings were diagnosed with autism, both of my parents had gotten distant from me it felt. i completely understand, and a lot of it i give myself shit for it. but also my younger siblings have been sheltered too much as well. it was hard then as a kid to tell them that there was a difference between compromising and spoiling. we gave them no structure or guidance. after awhile, i was left with most of responsibilities of watching and raising my younger siblings, which are the memories i enjoy most in my life. looking back now it was not all bad.the level of abuse between my parents ruined a lot of opportunities for us. always hurting themselves, us, our possessions, fighting, relocating, separating, getting back together again, rinse and repeat. lived through toxic before i knew what that meant. ran away for the first time when i was 11 and went across the county almost. it became clockwork. because of the constant moving, i could never maintain friendships. and on top of that i was scared to bring friends around. to some degree it got to a point where we filed a false domestic violence report on my father he actually was getting his shit together at the time to get into a farm program and avoid sleeping on the street. also a good time, learned martial arts, did gardening. another good time.parents had gotten back together at some point in time before high school. life was good for a bit, stable. then the issues arose. i was having issues with my parents then and went out and hung out with the wrong crowd, was partying and drinking all the time, even skipping school. i graduated but barely. my graduation on the other hand, was finding out my mother was gambling addict and also was in part to ruining a lot of our prospects in life.i do not want to hold onto any of this against my parents. now, they are still trying their best to survive, and they have changed over the years. but lately this surfaced too, and i have not felt well when i talked to my mother about this. she did not know what to say, and i began to be frustrated about it, but i realize now that she was not prepared to handle the issues i was going through, and she was trying her best. its still upsetting when she does not remember anything she has done wrong. but i need to move on, i love my mother and i only have one. no matter how batshit crazy she is.i love my dad, we are okay, we hang out, have lunch every once in awhile, and he is conscious of his actions. but he still has a lot of work to do. but i am proud of how far he is come. i love you dad.adulthood! the super condensed versionright after graduation was a shitshow. lost the place, me and pops split. ended up in a shelter for a year and a half. dad came here from a different country under extreme circumstances i do not want to get into, but frankly, he was prepared for life as much as i was. went to community college while homeless. got an apartment with other guys my age from the shelter. then realized alcoholism was genetic. fucked off my responsibilities. split. went upstate to stay with my mother. at the time i realized she was up to same tricks, which led to a lot of fights between us and eventually she stole from me and kicked me out. stayed with a girl next door, first relationship, then left me for the father of her baby i was still fucking off my responsibilities then and subsequently back on the street.moved around from place to place. met another girl, fell in love, but she had major depressive disorder and schizo. after a year, the relationship took a turn for the worst. she began to be emotionally abusive and always kicked me out. i did my best, but at the end of the day, we have come to terms that she never actually loved me. she went into another relationship a couple weeks later. but i fell hard.interesting part covidi moved back the other side of the state to stay with my dad. the place he had for me was a clean and sober house ran by a slumlord. then covid hit the states. i was quarantined in a horrible place, post breakup, living with my dad who was emotionally abusive. i could not handle it. i got my shit together got a job at the hospital and got my own apartment!now.been doing everything i needed to. kept up with bills, work out every day, eating healthy, drinking less. then i met this girl. same birthday, independent, very grounded. and now everything came back. now my anxiety is becoming debilitating in certain areas. i am becoming more irritable, although a lot of that is from the shortcomings of the healthcare industry. but if this is going to become a thing i need in dealing with this anxious attachment style. i have pushed away my remaining friends because of my last relationship, and i am starting to push everyone else away right now. either way if you made this far, thanks for taking the time. i know i am better than this and i know i can be better than this. i just wish i did not mess this up with her just to learn. frankly i just wish things like this did not happen just for a learning lesson. feels like the purpose of my life is just to be an example. do not be like this guy. i just want to be happy, and honest. i try to do the right thing in anything i do, and i try to help people as much as i can. but why i cannot be happy or trust other people? why cannot i just be happy?wishing i could time travel now.ampx200btry your best, because everything else is easy. always do the right thing. goodwill will always be paid forward. finding closure in my crazy life, to pursue true happiness within myself",Depression

7579,"apologies in advance if this post does not totally make sense, i am feeling emotional and i am also a bit high.i have been feeling extra suicidal for the past couple weeks, have a history of attempts, and i think sometimes when the suicidal feelings are this strong they stay strong until i 'do' something about them, i.e. try to off myself. and today i have been seriously considering doing it again, and am honestly trying to talk myself into it because the logistics are right dog would be taken care of and i had a therapy session today that basically seemed to confirm for me that things are hopeless and are not going to change any time soon. but, ambivalence.so.my dilemma is that if i am rational enough to think that i should maybe take myself to the psychiatric hospital er, then presumably that is me deciding not to kill myself, so then why am i even at the er? but if i do not take myself there, it is like suicide is still on the table and it is a 'should i or should not i' kind of torture until the point when these feelings get a little less strong which is not necessarily any time soon, based on recent history or i am upset enough to stop thinking rationally and try something impulsive. and i know i would just fail again. and i cannot deal with more of that flavour of shame.i know asking for advice on the internet for a topic like this is not ideal, so i am not asking whether you think i should go to the hospital or not, but maybe share what you have done if you have found yourself in a similar situation? i usually do not find helplines helpful and it is been a while since i went to er and i am just not sure if this is one of those times when it makes sense to go. i do not want to feel like a moron telling them i am there because i do not want to kill myself, and be stuck there for hours when it is not like they are going to be able to help improve anything short term. i already see a psychiatrist every other week so it is not like i need them to connect me with that resource. but going it alone when i am at this point can be scary and feels really painful and is probably kind of stupid sometimes. ampx200btldr when you have felt really suicidal but rational enough to realize you should do something to prevent yourself from acting on it, what did you do? how did it work out? need thoughts on going to the er or not",Suicidal

22722,"i plan to commit suicide somewhere in midaugust. i witnessed how my parents fought, one time at a resort where my mother tried to bash my father's head with a table lamp. for the first 4 years of school i was bullied, heavily. on my first day i got a mass beating because i cried on the celebration lineup. what followed is a big fight me vs everybody else in my class and a lot of hate towards my teachers. the 8 years of that school are some of the worst i can remember, partially because of my unstable mother. at some point my parents got divorced and my father was not living with us for a long time, but he could visit me. one time we went to a park but for some reason stopped at the place he was renting. when i got back my mother sensed something was odd and asked me what it was. she told me there would be no consequences if i told the truth. so i did. what followed is my most horrific memory to date. to put it simply, it involved a lot of slurs directed at me and my father, screaming and beating an expensive highend plasma tv with a hammer. things calmed down since then my parents now share the same apartment, i completed my basic education and so on. but something just never left me. a feeling of uselessness, desire to not exist anymore. it became apparent to me around 2 years ago and it got a somewhat of a deadline 6 months ago. basically, my situation is bad. the exams i studied for with very good and professional teachers from another school came out bad. like, i got my place in my university only because of some contest. and it did not pan out. i chose translation as my profession with the english and german languages. this summer i was to take my firstyear exam. german was a complete failure. i can retake it in september but it will not do much, why if the past year did not do it? basically i have nowhere to go. if i will retake the exams they will come out even worse, and my current scores will not get me into any university or college at all.for my whole life i felt like i do not belong here, like i was a mistake. well, it seems to be true. it is sad i will not get to witness my nineteenth birthday. how my cat's going to grow up. it is sad that i will leave my parents with no hope for the future. but it would be even more sad to live off them for the rest of my life, or to end up homeless. i am scared, but ultimately it does not change anything. in the end we are all ants on a big rock that is going to boil us alive. my absence is insignificant. i do not know where to go anymore",Suicidal

23195,"my entire life has spontaneously combusted over the last couple of months. a 7year relationship that i moved across the country for four years ago ended suddenly. my expartner, my best friend in the world, within a month of our breakup, started dating a mutual friend who has spent the entirety of the pandemic harassing, bullying, manipulating, and gaslighting our friends conveniently, everyone but my partner. she has been aware of this, to the extent that i have been comfortable confiding in her, because this friend has been making many of us feel like garbage. meanwhile she is only gotten closer to them as they have driven a wedge between themselves and the rest of us, and the way she describes them is exactly the opposite of how the rest of us experience them she excuses their behavior easily with things they have told her, but she does not see how a million separate excuses for individual examples of horrible behavior add up to a really ugly picture of a pathological liar and manipulator.and now, suddenly within a month of our breakup, they are fucking. meanwhile i am trying and failing to find a place to live and a place to work. my best lead on an apartment right now needs me to have a job i was high risk for covid and went on unemployment and have been struggling to find work, i finally gave up after getting absolutely no responses and applied at a cafe my friend works at, lowering my standards down to the fucking floor. but the commute there is an hour both ways by bus despite being a 15minute drive.i am going to end up in an apartment alone which scares me i have been depressed my whole life and have a lot of trouble with it when i am by myself, i cannot do any repetitive tasks without someone to talk to without cycling through suicidal thoughts even at the best of times, without my cat she is taking the cat because she can afford to, i cannot, losing my insurance when i left my job due to the pandemic our domestic partnership let me be added to hers and thus losing my therapist who was out of network for months, who i would been paying out of pocket for the whole time, 175 per week which i could not afford, who was finally very recently paneled by my insurance and was added to it, just as i am finally coming to terms with a lot of the gender issues and dysphoria i have dealt with my entire life which my partner helped me through a lot of, and i was just, finally sitting on the precipice of a lot of positive change.even after we broke up, she wanted to keep living with me. we found a perfect place. we applied, got accepted, they wrote the lease, sent it to us, and then she decided she wanted to live alone. she started spending more time with our abusive friend. they started dating, which is an insane rebound less than a month after the end of a 7year relationship? and just. extremely insensitive to me generally i find it shitty to date within a friend group, but to date a friend's recent longterm ex is about a thousand steps too far, and she even realizes this. she told me that, yeah, it was shitty. but she needed to do something for herself, to make herself happy.i am depressed. i have a low opinion of myself. i have a habit of telling myself that i deserve bad things. but i did not deserve that. i know i did not. i am still living with my ex because we are still on this lease they could not even wait until we lived separately.i was in a horrible pit of depression during the pandemic. shit kept going wrong. my mom attempted suicide right beforehand, it started right when i almost landed a new job, then george floyd and protests and wildfires and a thousand things, and i just sort of shut down due to depression. she felt like she was carrying the weight for both of us. which is fair. i wish i would been more. conscious, i guess.but to do something so immediate, so callous, so thoughtless, and then to tell me to my face that she recognizes that it is shitty but she does not care, and that she wants us to still be best friends despite it.she knows how i feel about them, has for a long time. she is always been my best friend, and i confided in her when i was afraid and confused and did not yet know the rest of our friends were experiencing the same thing. she knows how they have hurt me, hurt our other friends. she just keeps repeating the excuses they have given her.i am going to be stuck in a shitty job with two hours of commuting each day. i am going to be stuck alone in an apartment. i am not going to have the mental energy to do things i want to do i had just outlined most of a novel series, i was ready to start writing it right before the breakup i will not have the mental capacity or time to find another fucking job. i had just been grappling with this gender dysphoria and was looking into transitioning. i do not know that i can do that alone. i do not know that i can do anything if i am spending 11 hours of my day, 5 days a week traveling and working. my supposed best friend honestly just fucking betrayed me her leaving suddenly hurt, but jumping in bed with the last fucking person in the world i would ever be comfortable around, someone she knows well has hurt me. i had already been grappling with her dating other people because she said she wanted to start dating casually i had wrapped my head around it, she said it would be a long time before she could even think about entering another actual relationship. and then, suddenly, she starts fucking an abusive, manipulative, horrible presence in my life, someone our friends have been working up to a confrontation with as they continue to sink their teeth in.i just do not know her anymore. she is a completely different person. i cannot understand what she sees in them, i cannot understand why she is doing any of this, it all came out of nowhere, and i cannot see my life getting any better from here. it feels like my life is over. it feels like i have nothing. even our friend group is fracturing because of this fucking manipulative bastard sitting in the middle of it, laughing while they tear people down around them. i have no motivation. i am confused. i am lost. i am empty. i feel like i keep falling off of cliffs, one after another.i could move back east, live with my mom again. she is been asking me to do that the whole four years i have lived out west. she cries. she says she is depressed, has nothing without me, that she does not know what to do without me. but living with her was miserable. i could not do anything. i could not flourish. and then after 3 years of long distance i moved out west, giving up everything, and then i did flourish. for 4 years i grew and became something. i felt at home, at peace, i had a partner who i loved more than anything. we were a team, we were adventuring companions, we were each other's home.and now that is all gone. i do not know what to do. i do not know where to go from here. i feel empty and lost and shitty and i am stuck with the reality of this person who is been nothing but horrible to my friends and i running off with the woman i love, seemingly developing an entire false personality that is completely the opposite of how they behave whenever she is not around. they are the one fucking person in the world i could not handle her leaving me for. and fucking talking about them makes me feel insane, because developing an entire separate personality for the sake of manipulation sounds fucking crazy, it is something i would not believe at all if it is not something i was witnessing with my own eyes, and had not already seen my father do for years, and if i was the only one seeing it. but i am not. a number of us do.i just want to wake up. i just want to wake up from this dream. i gave everything for this relationship and now i have nothing. she still wants to be friends, she calls me her best friend, but friends do not act this callous, and i do not know how to be friends with someone who makes me feel this betrayed, this empty, this desperate and lonely and horrible.i do not want to be stuck in an apartment by myself, in a deadend job that eats up half of every day. i do not want to be stuck with my overbearing mom again. i do not want to be stuck with strangers. everyone i know is on a lease. none of these situations offer me the time or freedom or energy to be the person i have been fighting to become. i cannot imagine a version of the future that has any kindness, any hope. i have no motivation. i have had a knot in my gut for weeks that will not go away. i want this abuser out of my life. i want my best friend to at least act with some compassion. i want my cat. i want to feel home again, i want to feel family. i want to be able to eat without feeling sick.i want one more night where we sit together in bed reading separate books, and to turn off the lights to hold each other close. i want to go home again. i want to wake up from this fucking nightmare reality that i am stuck in where absolutely every single fear i have ever had is coming true. i want to stop feeling alone in this city i barely know, i want community and companionship and hope and inspiration and motivation and some fucking happiness.i want my fucking best friend back.instead i just feel empty of anything but gutwrenching pain. i am staring at a deadend future and nothing but bad options. fuck this. let me wake up. please, let me wake up. losing absolutely everything. betrayed by the most important person in my life. i am stuck in a bad dream i cannot wake up

34241,"pretty bad anxiety towards taking meds with a possibility to prolong qt. help. warning this post got much, much longe r than i anticipated. sorry to however actually reads this entire essay. so, i have a psychiatrist who recently prescribed me sertraline for chronic depressionptsd and trazodone for sleep but i actually haven't taken either. this specific phobia started like 11 12 yrs ago i think. i had walking pneumonia a few weeks ago and absolutely had to take antibiotics and holy shit, my anxiety was thru the roof every time i was time to take it. i was absolutely convinced my qt interval was significantly prolonged and i was going to die in my sleep! i feel like i narrowly escaped death after i finished the course. which is ridiculous. i have had ekgs countless times, probably like over 10 times ftr i'm only 18 and only started getting them in the last two years and for the most part, were completely 100 normal shocker. excluding this one time during my purging like 3x a day and keeping literally nothing down phase where my hearts repolarization phase fucked beyond belief. actually i'm just going to talk about that a little because the anxiety still plagues me. my heart was physically rattling shaking in my chest with every beat, like it was unsure of how to beat normally. it was incredibly scary, i think i experienced what i believe was possibly a very brief arrhythmia. at first i thought it may have been a minor seizure which wouldn't be that unrealistic, as purging electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia, sleep deprivation i had stayed up all night, physical activity while literally running on empty we were inside playing basketball when it all started and of course hypoglycemia essentially noteating will do that to ya all lower the seizure threshold, and also how i might have had a seizure once back when i was abusing dxm constantly which of course predisposes you to future seizures because of how disoriented i got and how everything became slow motion, almost similar to the time distortion one would get on a psychedelic. .but that didn't explain how my heart rate was reaching 140 for the record, throughout the last 2ish years that i have been measuring it, it has always, always sat at a comfy 5560 while not using hrraising drugs such as dxm or speed when i got it taken in the nurses office in the psychiatric facility, and how i felt like i was about to die. when i went and got that ekg i believe actually traumatized me in a way. coming fairly close to death which has actually happened to me a numerous times, with my purging phase, over exercising phase i actually kept a fucking exercise bike in my tiny ass room and legit would use it non stop for 35 hours to burn off literally everything i ate and then some, feeling proud when my net calories for the day ended up in the negative. it was bad, real bad restriction phase i have eaten less than 500 calories day for months at a time, several times, in fact i can feel a restriction phase coming on, as i am pushing myself to not eat, god i hate being eating disordered, but st this point it's a safety blanket after i've been dealing with this shit day n day out since 13 yrs old me first decided to eat like 100 calories a day for 2 or 3 months can't rmmbr cos i was obese. cant really remember if i started out with disordered thinking and intentions, or if it just was a crash dietturned weird obsession and addiction to weight loss. and also, this one non eating disorder related time i was riding in a car with my mom maybe 1 12 years ago , legit almost got tboned we would have been hit on myher side of the car, had we been just 2 seconds slower getting through the intersection, that person would have hit us. oddly enough, she was panicking, yet i f elt absolutely nothing, no adrenaline, no fear, nothing. i attribute that to how i learned to dissociate from everything at. a young age due to my father's husband abusing us constantly lol dissociation as a coping mechanism is cool not i wholeheartedly believe i could have died if i continued with the purging i still get extreme anxiety when i analyze that specific ekg i know i should throw it out but i just can't, i am a person who is very much into record keeping. i feel like i am not actually alive, that i died months years ago, and this is maybe purgatory. i alternate between genuinely feeling like i should truly not be am not actually alive, because of all of this shit. not sure if that's connected to the ptsd or what. i mean, i was dxd with major depressive disorder with psychotic features, at one point. god my life is a nightmare. i so desperately wish to take the place of a normal person ie didn't have an abusive biological father, isn't a piece of shit drug addict, doesn't harm themselves via eating habits and excessive exercise, doesn't have all these stupid ridiculous mental things. how did my life end up like this. i fantasize about it alot. normal people with normal lives take that shit for granted. it angers me. they just don't understand how goddamn lucky they fucking are, holy fucking shit. oops, sorry for the going off on a total tangent. that happens to me sometimes. anyway.how do i get over this. i honestly would not take any med like that on a daily basis unless i had an at home ekg that i could use like 12 times a day. actually, every time i discontinued an ssri or antipsychotic it as because i could sense that my qt interval was prolonged. even if the drug was helping me. it's horrible. i have a cardiologist appointment soon because i got minor chest pains during exercise a few weeks ago. which doesn't sound particularly bad, but that, coupled with the knowledge of the fact that many people can have silent heart attacks and asymptomatic arrhythmias, it's downright terrifying. i am scared about what i might find out, if i mayhaps did permanent, structural, unfixable damage to my heart muscle from a only a several month long bulimic episode, and am now much, much more vulnerable to cardiac events. i almost don't want to go. now what's weird about this phobia, is that i currently am using xanax at night and meth during the day and i'm also a smoker. its weird how those three things are pretty notgood for you, yet i have less anxiety about smoking a cig or a bowl of meth than taking an anti depressant? it's so irrational and honestly i believe it's an ocd thing as i also tend to take my blood pressure 420 times a day no fucking joke and weigh my self constantly and also check my pulse to see if my heart rhythm is normal about 10x a day. my blood pressure is so good that even as i am fucking high out of my mind on meth and just smoked a cig, the highest it goes is like 13085 which, insanely and funnily enough, is still probably lower than like 70 of americas blood pressure, lmao, which is just slightly hypertensive. it's normally, with only the cigs and no meth, like 9060, sometimes even like 8557, no lie. i attribute it to my whole foodplant based diet. i'm not really sure why i still compulsively take my bp. but anyway this anxiety is destroying me. i really do think i need to be on an ssri or something, but i guarantee i could not even take a single benadryl without panicking hardcore. so. does anyone deal with this fear of an abnormal heart rhythm specifically? i just wonder how common it is. and how people deal with it. end xanax fueled rant about my mental issues. i would be shocked if anyone actually reads this entire essay",Anxiety

52341,"separation anxiety in the recent few years i've very well acknowledged that i am a pretty anxious person and i kinda got used to it. but something that still bothers me is my separation anxiety and the constant fear of being abandoned by my friends. i don't know how to go about it, especially now that i have a best friend to whom i can't talk all the time, whenever i want or need to. they seem to be more of the avoidant style. i find it very difficult to go through my day if whenever i think of them and talking to them, i have to stop myself and 'give them space.' i don't mean this in a selfish way, naturally i am a pretty understanding person. i try to control my 'urges' for contact, which i crave a lot, but it's been getting harder as the days go by. most of the time i don't even have something important to say, it's just my thoughts and things i mention throughout the day, but i feel blue when i remember that they do not 'prefer' texting everyday because that is something that i really like, want and need. i try my best to respect their boundaries and i am the one to 'adapt' to their needs for space. just recently i started wondering whether it is okay that i bring this up as a boundary and a need of mine. i feel like i've often been the one to change for them and it's been getting to me lately. i don't mean any harm to my bestie and we don't have any other 'unsolvable' problem except for this one. is it okay to text them? is it selfish? i get a lot of thoughts and i address them as anxiety but it doesn't get any easier even when i am fully aware of that. i just wish to put an end to this. it has been affecting my mood lately, i check the messages app hundreds of times only to see no texts from them. i get anxious waiting for a reply and even more anxious when i first think of something to say. it just pops into my mind and i happily open the app but as soon as i start typing i remember the situation and feel guilty about texting them. but then again, i feel very empty if i don't. how do i go about this?",Anxiety

23892,"alright, so first i have to admit that my biggest need in life is to feel loved. not just loved, but to have someone that finds me attractive and is turned on by me and my body. including my penis. now, when i was younger. say, teen and young adult. i really did not care too much about my penis size. sure i would be a bit embarressed by it and was always one to hold off on sexual activities until i had been with a girl for a little while. but it did not because depression. i am in my 30's now and my life experiances has taken me from thinking size is not everything to litterally crying more often then i would like to admit over my penis size. i am a grower first off. and at full staff its not too bad i guess. below average but not micro by any means. but soft its less then an inch for sure. in fact. when i am sitting down its litterally inside me. anyway. because of this i have never been much for one night stands or to go around having sex with lots of woman. with the exeption of twice in my life, i have just been a long term relationship type. i have had 4 previous relationships one was marriage for almost 10 years. and i am on my 5th currently. all 4 of those, i was cheated on. multiple times. my ex wife i had even found that she was telling the other guys that i was small and she did not get turned on my it. taking something i was already a little self consious about, and adding in that every girlfriend i have had has cheated on me. i am now very needy in terms of exeptence of my penis size. my current relationship, we have sex once or twice a month and that is it. she says she is just not a very sexual person. but see, we were friends before we started dating and, she used to talk about loving to give blowjobs, and she even had a fwb just because she loved giving them so much she had someone she could just go suck any time she wanted. so i cannot help but feel like its me. like i have an underwelling penis that just does not get her going. my life at this point revolves around my self loathing over my penis size. i feel like the one thing i need more then anything i can never have because no girl gets excited about small penis'. the best i hear is woman that say they do not mind it. or that it does not matter to them. but i clearly have never even found that. i do love my current girlfriend and she is good to me any many non sexual ways. and i feel i cannot give my true feelings to her because that might seem like guilt tripping and when it comes to sex, guilt tripping someone, in many ways, is a bit. well. i cannot think of the word so i will use an example. a guy that guilts a woman into sex because she gave him blue balls would be considered a pig right? so i feel like if i talked about this with her it would be similar. like. oh you should have sex with me more because i need to feel like my penis size is ok. i just cannot do that. i do not feel right about it. even if i know in my head that is not my reason. in my head i am not doing it as a guilt trip. that is still kind of too close to the same category. so i sit here. so damned depressed that i cannot even take care of myself when i feel the urge sometimes. i feel sad and like i will never feel truly loved and desired. you know, let us talk about porn for a moment. i am not one to use it when i am in a relationship. but i had a few years between my ex and my current girl to have watched a bit and really dig around to see what is out there. and i am starting to cave a bit and use it from time to time just because of how in frequent we have sex. but the point of bringing up porn is this. there is fetishes for basically everything. feet fetishes. old people. fat people. short people. tall people. big boobs. small boobs. ect ect. i mean the list is endless. but you know what i cannot find? a porn fetish catagory for woman that like small dicks. you can find a fetish for woman that like to be pee'd on and deficated on. but not that like small penis'. in fact. the only small penis fetish i can find is humiliation. which is the last thing i want to see and just know that its out there depresses me even more. its depressing to think that every woman i have ever been with has been so displeased by it that they decided to go find a bigger one to play with on the side. i tried anonymous video sites a few times when i was single and that left me crying every time. you find a girl that wants to cam with you. and as soon as she see's what i am working with, she either clicks off immediatly, or she stays to laugh and call it small. there was one time that i thought that maybe witholding the information that i had a small dick until the relationship was a few weeks old or more was my problem. so when i was talking to this one girl, i waiting for her to bring up sex in the conversation and when she finally did, i informed her i was small. she asked for a picture so i sent her one. she litterally just stopped replying. never heard from her again. like. i genuinly feel like maybe they feel like they have been scammed or something. start a relationship with me. i seem like a good boyfriend. and then bam. small dick. i do not know what to do. i know i should not put so much into my penis size. but my life experiances has caused this and i can no longer convince myself its ok. i can no longer believe size does not matter. or its the motion of the ocean. or that looks are not everything. or that you can make up for it in bed with other things like mouth skills and so on. i just want someone to genuinly like my penis. and i will never have that. small member causing major depression",Depression

twice in a period of about 23 minutes, then another couple times when i circled back to the topic. he was not retaining or processing half of what i was saying. but, still he seemed to care and it at least felt good to talk, so i was not overly concerned.he stopped the session at the time it would have stopped if he was ontime, so i really only had half a session.two weeks later the second session comes. he had invited me to come in, inperson going forward. for some reason this time they would not charge it from my hra so i had to pay 130 outofpocket for the deductible, but that is another story.he is on time this time. i had mentioned i just got out of work and he starts asking questions about work. i thought it was rapport building or whatnot but he began to dig deeper and deeper into work, asking about stressors, etc. this morphed into financial responsibilities, and the stresses those can because, and other related things. after a while i felt it got off the rails. this was not the reason i requested therapy, as stated on my new patient forms and in my first session. but, i figured he is going somewhere with it.well it ended up with the therapist honing in on responsibilities finances obligations causing a weight on my shoulders, and how we can work more on that next time.wtf?i understand he might not remember every little detail from our first session, but it was like he had no clue what i was there for? i left feeling defeated. realization set in that the first session where i poured my heart out was completely unaccounted for, and that my therapist thinks i am just there for some sort of jobfinancial stress management.part of my issues include low confidence and very little assertiveness. people have always walked all over me. as such i could not bring myself to ask any confrontational questions about whether he recalls the topics of the first session, or why we are not building on those. i just kind of realized it was a loss and that was that.as a couple days went by i began to become more depressed as i felt even more hopeless, and after 6 months of waiting. for this? for literally nothing? then it turned into anger, which is not like me. but i am truly pretty upset that the person i was counting on helping me never bothered to review my initial forms or take notes on what my issues are. that he barely seems to retain information i told him one or two sentences ago, let alone the entire reason i am sitting in front of him.the fuck do i do now? i have not cancelled my third session. i figured maybe i should go at least three times to make sure. but not going to lie, i checked reviews and while there are not many, they said he was the worst therapist they would ever had.i am on medication at least. thought it has not helped yet. started with lexapro which even at the initial dosage, it was making me super ill to my stomach for weeks on end. it did not agree with me.moved on to zoloft and it has not really started helping yet, but my stomach is fine now. it had some heavy sexual side effects so my doctor added wellbutrin about a week and a half ago. still no change in mood or the side effects but i am hoping this starts to kick in for now. i know it can take a while.fuck. waited 6 months for my first psychotherapy appointment. after 2 sessions it was so bad i now feel worse",Depression

17528,"i have a degenerative disorder called myasthenia gravis. it has progressed to the point where some days i cannot even lift my hands to style my hair. the disease is exacerbated by stress. i am a preschool teacher on summer break and during my entire summer my mom has been in and out of the hospital and almost died 3 times. i am her primary caregiver because i am the only female in the house. i physically do not have it in me to keep washing, dressing, wiping and feeding her. i also have to take care of her 96 year old father. when i tried to explain this to mom on before discharge, she said to shut up and stop talking to her. she cannot or will not acknowledge what is happening to my body and just takes it as i must not love her.i went home and contemplated suicidethankfully i did not do it. but i spent the entire day terrified and just wanting someone in my family to do something like just sit with me. what ended up happening has crushed me. mom ended up coming home from the hospital the same day as that fight. i was arguing with her saying that i did not feel loved at all anymore. my brother overheard and tried to intervene. he angrily said he will have to use his lunch break to come feed her and asked if i would help too and i said i cannot do all the things i did before. he got mad. i explained that i cannot do them not because i am a jack ass but because of my medical condition and blurted out that i did not want to live anymore. he yelled at me saying that i was trying to make it all about myself and my problems and told me to get away from him and go call a suicide hotline. then he just started wailing and bawling saying he is the only healthy person in the family and cannot care for all of us. i spent the night comforting him he ended up making it all about himself when that was all i really needed. when i talked to my father about feeling suicidal, he just ignored me and talked about something else.school starts soon and i am in no shape physically or emotionally to go back. i finally see a doctor on monday that will hopefully start treatment for my disease so i can get my strength back. however the emotional holes left behind from what happened are really hard to heal. my family made it very clear that i do not matter and nobody cares. i do not know how to move on from that. the only survival tactic i came up with was to pretend i am fine and continue to kill myself physically by taking care of everyone and ignoring my own health issues.like i always do. because apparently that is the only way for the family to function. any help or advice would be very appreciated. i am at the end of my rope. nobody cares",Depression

17681,"recently, i realized my depression stems from life being a neverending cycle of having to. always do things. the laundry is never permanently done. every time i wash my hair and get it nicely styled i will have to wash it and try to get it looking nice again. and again. and again. every time i finish a project for work there will be another one. i always have to eat would not it be great if i did not need to? either i forget to eat, do not have the energy to eat, or i eat too much. every time i lose weight i gain it again and i will have to work super hard to lose it again. every time my face clears up my period comes around and i get another breakout again and then spend too much money on makeup to cover it up, which also does not help my skin. i excelled in school, but i was always in this mindset of i just need to get through this and everything will be great. fill the blank in with whatever you would likesemester, project, shift, day, hour, diet. i was only ever powering through things then, and slowly, i got worse and worse at doing that and started missing deadlines and not taking care of myself going to bed without brushing my teeth, skipping showering because i was running late and feeling gross all day, etc. i chalked it up to senioritis. oh, i am just a bit burnt out, i will gain my productivity back after i have a bit of a break. however, that senioritis has not gone away, and now i am out of school constantly sending so sorry i am behind on this. emails because i cannot keep up with work at all. i selfimpose deadlines only to miss them. i have others put deadlines on me only to not hit them. and it is not because i am busy. i am not. i graduated with my ma in december and i cannot seem to land a full time gig with it or even get a chance to interview anywhere. i am not qualified enough for a lot of jobs i am, like, half qualified and that makes me terrified to apply for fear of looking stupid orwhat if i get the job and then i do a bad job and destroy future career prospects? currently, i am freelancing and doing part time work but i am not making enough to move out of my parents house and that only makes doing the work i am doing now feel all the more useless and makes me procrastinate even more. i am letting people down. that used to be the worst case scenario for me, but now i seem to have moved past that into full apathy. i am just letting my professional self that i worked so hard to build in school fall apart entirely because i cannot find the will to do more than drag myself out of bed at like noon i work remotely and force myself to eat something. just responding to a simple email is the biggest win i have had in months and whenever i do manage to force myself to finish something i feel like death aftersucked of all energy and life with a raging headache. god, life is just so exhausting and there is no excuse for it other than i do not want to go on and do not have the energy to do so. i think i may be a bit suicidal is the scariest thing i have said aloud to my mom, and i think i freaked her out. i am only 24 and i wish my life was over despite everything being amazing on paper up until this point. what has happened to me? it used to feel like there was a light at the end of the tunnel but now i think it is just a never ending tunnel. there is no end. just death. but at the same time i have so much i want to achieve and see and do. my creativity is actually something i think i have managed to gain back after years of school punching that out of me, but you do not get paid for being able to doodle or write the occasional story. i do think that my small personal projects with no deadlines and no eyes on them but mine are the only thing keeping me going right now, but even that feels like work half the time. i say i love writing, but that is not true. i love having written. i do not like the doing, just the have done feeling where i get the satisfaction of completing the thing and it being good. but is it even worth the work for that rush? i do not even know what to think anymore. i am just done. 2021 is half way over and i have done nothing with it. i started the year off in a bad place and it has gotten only worse, not better. no progress whatsoever. life is just doing things",Depression

18095,"i grew up in a town that was huge on high school athletics. pretty much every boy was expected to play something or else they were treated as different. i am on the spectrum myself and sports were the thing i turned to when i wanted to escape the reality of my situation. ill be the first to admit i was a bit of a jock and because of that status, people barely recognized my condition or at the very least, gave me a pass for it. i played 3 sports, which i dominated in and was a ladies man throughout my teen years. i was truly on top of the world. each year, my school would hold a massive pep rally a month into the school year. the pep rallys were an all day thing that would feature multiple events. the biggest event of them all was the athletic competition. hundreds of students, boys and girls, would compete in multiple activities and would be eliminated one by one until a winner was crowned. i had won the competition during my freshman, sophomore, and junior year. in the 50 year history of the event, i was the only student who had ever won three straight competitions. i was fully prepared to win a fourth straight and complete the dynasty. the athletic director had told me the school would gift me a scholarship fund if i was able to win it all one more time. as usual, i breezed through the competition early and comfortably secured my spot in the final round yet again. no surprises there. this time my finals opponent would, for the first time, be a girl who just happened to be a freshman. she was tall and lanky and posed no real threat to me off the naked eye. the final round would consist of a basketball shootout, first to 10 wins. basketball is my best sport and i felt as if they were almost gifting the championship to me. i took an early 50 lead but she ended up getting into a lucky hot streak and won 107. she defeated me and became the champion. i was humiliated and went into a massive depression. i know that i deserved to be the one holding that trophy and seeing her hoist it up killed me. the rest of my senior year remains a blur to me. to put even more salt in the wound, the same girl that defeated me would go on to win the competition in her 10th11th12th grade years. she got the dynasty that she denied me of. the pain comes and goes but has been really strong recently. i was humiliated and will never be able to live it down. i know its silly because i am 28 and she is 24 now but i just cannot seem to let go of the past. i know its unhealthy to be this upset all these years later, but i cannot help but think about it each night. i toss and turn thinking about how all of this it could have been prevented had i just won. i could have been the one who completed the dynasty, not that lucky little bitch who has ruined my life. i cannot get over something that happened nearly ten years ago. advice?",Depression

'why?' you might ask. well, i'll tell you a little bit about me.i am an overweight female who has gone through shit in my 26 years of living. my childhood was basically robbed of me, mainly because i witnessed fights and screaming matches between family members and a near divorce with the parentals. i was also bullied majority of my early childhood all the way through middle school. after all of this happened and there was a lot more than that, i felt like i was forced to grow up and basically chose 'flight mode' to save myself. what i mean by that is, closing myself off. staying in my room and coming out when i absolutely have to. i have a fear of being rejected, and being a failure. i am afraid of being yelled at for doing something wrong and i have a fear of getting into trouble and being reprimanded. i still live with my parents and i have no job because of just basically, being socially anxious. i stutter around people i don't know and that makes me even more anxious and selfconscious. i forget things easily and that in turn, furthers my fear of being incapable of a job. on top of that, i have trouble sleeping at night because thoughts run through my head a million times a second. because of this, i wake up late almost everyday at 11am. just tonight, my mom basically dumped a, 'we need to talk' case on me and already i felt my blood run cold. she's talking to me but all i hear is my heart thumping in my ears. she tells me i need to work on waking up early because the rest of the world wakes up early like adults. i felt very offended by that and told her that it's not my fault that i can't sleep properly at night. i, in fact, tell this to her everyday, so it's not old news. yet, when i did remind her of this, she basically sighed and almost wanted to roll her eyes. then she tells me i need a week to just 'work on myself' to fix that and realistically, thats not how that works but i didn't say anything. then she tells me i need to find a job. something that pays and that 70 of the world gets up and does a 9 to 5 job which i already knew. now, i was starting think she thinks i'm lazy or something when it's absolutely not the case. truth is, i have been getting together with my younger sister who is an artist on doing freelance stuff that we are both interested in doing. we have been talking about it little by little. i told my mom this and she didn't seem to believe me, basically looking at me with an expression of, ohhh really like what. so she asks, okay, what have y'all worked on today? of all things she asks on the day me and my younger sister decide to take at least the day off from planning. i said, well, we are taking a break today but i designed some stuff for xx and sended it to her and she reformatted and polished it up. my mom seemed to deflate in a way that said, 'that was it?' not gonna lie, it made me feel bad and then she went into a repeated 5 minute lecture on how we need to wake up earlier and start the day like adults. meanwhile i'm here depressed, stressed and just over it at this point. over the fact that she just doesn't understand at all. she says, 'i know you can do it. i know that.' but does she really? anytime i do, 'do it', she seemes to be unsatisfied and that pushes me a million steps back. i get upset and after we finish talking, i go to my room to sleep 11pm at this point and i just start bawling at how useless i felt and the whole, 'why is my life like this'. it took so much in me not to burst into tears in front of her but man my throat was tighrening so bad it hurt that i couldn't speak for a good few seconds. i don't know, i guess i just need some advice on the situation? anytime i'm in this position my stress literally goes through the roof and i don't know how to manage it like the need to runaway, disappear or worse. i really do want to work, i want to recieve a paycheck and get my own place and my own car and things, but why am i always on flight mode all the time?",Stress

47934,"not sure about what to do with my life. for the past 4 years i've 18m struggled with depression, i guess it started with the very turbulent divorce of my parents a violent fuckfest when i was 14yo in 2019, it was at that time that i started doing drugs such as mdma, lsd and cocaine, however i'd say my drug consumption really started as young as 12 given that i would abuse my adhd medication ritalin by snorting it. later down that year i had some pretty shitty moments with my mother physical violence as my father abandoned us to go live in another country for half the year, when he came back, they found out about my drug usage, which again ended up in physical abuse and the over infantilization of a 15 yo boy who never had any freedom or power in his life, my parents started walking me to school it was 2 blocks away from home lmao, once they even punched me infront of my classmates and threatened some random boy about beating him up because they confused him with someone i smoked weed with. at the end of that year they sent me to love with my grandma in another country. there i was, all alone in a country that was foreign to me although i was born there, i had family of course, but i can't really be myself around my family, the year was 2020 and i was just starting classes again when the pandemic hit, it was at that point when i abandoned my studies for the first time, tbh i didn't suffer through covid because i lived with my cousin and we played videogames all day, but i ended up drinking a ton of alcohol in secret again, sniffing gas from the stove, stealing pills from my grandma, because i was desperate, life felt like it physically weighted on me, i stopped eating because sadness did not allow me to, i started getting weaker and weaker untill 10onths later my mother picked me up and we returned to tje country i was raised in. it did not get better for a long time. my mother did not trust me at all and didn't allow me to go outside i was 16 at the time, she even hid the keys from me. as i realized that she would never trust me again i said fuck it and started smoking weed again, yadda yadda i start studying again and pass the year yay, but still, i was a 17yo boy who isolated himself for 2 years and didn't talk irl to anyone that wasn't family, i developed a serious internet addiction due to it. in 2022 stuff got slightly better, but not really, during summer break i met a girl 26yo online, and we start talking, we like each other, the first time i left my house in years for something that wasn't school was to meet her, which i did, at the cemetery, i was 17. later in that year i get into an altercation with my mother and she beats me again and kicked me out of her house, after that i live with my father for a couple weeks before she decided to ask me to come back home again she never said sorry, i get even more depressive to the point i abandon my studies again. then i become 18 years old, and this 26yo girl i talked about before asks to unvirgin me to which i said yes, she invited me to her brother's bday party. when everyone went to sleep, we were in bed together, i was sleepy and high, and she was drunk and coked tf up, we had a very awkward kiss, i then say that i forgot to bring condoms and she mounts me anyway before i could say anything. after that shitty experience we become a couple, my first girlfriend ever yay. fuck it was a rollercoaster of shit, she was abusive, she offered me coke after i was clean for 3 years, she insulted me and said i was only useful for sex, she even slapped me a couple of times. why does everyone abuses me? now, 2023, i have my first job, but i still struggle with my weight, which makes me very self aware of how weak and small i am. i feel ugly, i feel emasculated. now i have to study again and i just can't keep up with study and work my work shift goes from 4am to 12pm, and my classes go from 6pm to 12am i just want to give up, i feel like i don't deserve anything, i just want to sleep and sleep and wake up when everything's allright. sorry i don't know why i wrote this, sorry for the english.",Depression

34902,"some very helpful words to put things in perspective this is an article i found that makes me feel profoundly better every time i read it. i posted it as a comment a few weeks ago, but i thought it might reachhelp more people as its own post. it seems relevant to some recent posts on this sub. i'll post the url in the comments, but here it is we all worry about our health from time to time, at least to some degree, but some people worry excessively about catastrophic consequences of seemingly benign symptoms. theyre known as hypochondriacs. this is the sort of process hypochondriacs go through whats that? a benign lump or malignant bump on your face, breast or rump? adrenaline rush, heart pumping, sweating, and lightheadedness follow, confirming the gravity of the terminal selfdiagnosis. thoughts racing and images of a foreshortened future, orphaned children, and opportunities missed. overwhelming distress. must plan the epitaph see, i told you i was sick! our future and physical health are inherently uncertain. but people with hypochondriasis immediately resolve any uncertainty about novel physical sensations and symptoms on the side of catastrophe. the body is constantly in a state of flux. the heart pumps, blood flows, muscles twitch, lungs inflate, and bowels contract. strange symptoms come and go. and most pass without conscious awareness as we focus on daily tasks. but try this. hold your hand upwards, so that your palm and fingertips face the sky. focus all your attention on the tips of your fingers and wait and wait until you notice some sensations. tingling, temperature changes, or just an awareness of the sensations on your skin. heres an even simpler task. as you read this, shift your attention on to the sensations of the ground or chair pushing up against your body. chances are you were unaware of all these sensations just moments ago. attention, you see, is the microscope of the mind. it can filter in or out any of your internal or external experiences. now imagine becoming hypervigilant to all the physical changes naturally occurring in your body. try it. just focus on all the sensations in your body for a minute. amazing, isnt it? itchy toes, tense jaw, mild headache, numbness, and so on. all the normal workings of a healthy body. people with somatic symptom disorder are experts at searching for and noticing normal bodily changes. theyre also experts at interpreting these in potentially catastrophic ways fatigue is leukemia a lump on the arm is cancer. the number one enemy of someone with the disorder is dr google cyberchondria. indeed, the only thing more catastrophically creative than a hypochondriacs mind is googles 2.42 million webpages on the causes of cancer. every possible symptom can be linked to every possible diagnosis, by at least one disreputable source or another. the hypochondriac is searching not for information, but for confirmation of their imminent demise. if theyre unlucky, they might come across contradictory information or additional ailments they hadnt yet considered. their intense worry and anxiety feel intolerable and must be neutralised. seeking out a sympathetic doctor or other source of reassurance, or avoiding the health section of the newspaper all provide temporary relief until the next physical symptom is perceived. so what are some things that keep hypochondriacs worrying? belief worrying will help me catch something early. no, it wont. worrying will just keep you miserable until youre old enough to find out how you will shuffle off this mortal coil unless, of course, your demise is a blissfully brief surprise. worry itself will not get you any closer to predicting, preventing, or planning for your death. belief i can get certainty about my health. nope, cant get that either. no amount of checking, doctor visits, googling, reassuranceseeking will guarantee with 100 certainty that youre well. i can, however, guarantee that the unrelenting pursuit of certainty will make you miserable. so, how can you manage health anxiety? first, develop some healthy guidelines for monitoring your health and stick to them. based on your past experience, how long do benign symptoms typically last? one day, two days, one week? decide how long you will wait before seeking any form of certainty or reassurance from the internet, friends, family, or medical practitioners the next time you notice a symptom, especially ones youve worried about in the past. once this time expires no pun intended, make a decision about whether you need to get the symptom checked or whether you can wait another little while before doing so. follow guidelines from reputable sources about the recommended frequency of body checking. and, be willing to sit with uncertainty about your health. none of us ever have certainty about our health. i could have a brain tumour as i write these words. i am willing to accept this possibility and shift my attention onto the next paragraph. think about it this way if i offered you a 2 million insurance policy for your house, even if i promised to build you a goldplated replacement if it were destroyed, you would likely consider it far too expensive. so, how much are you willing to pay to prevent any possibility of illness? are you willing to give up your capacity to work, time you would otherwise spend with friends and family, and ultimately your happiness? this is a very high price to pay. spend energy on things you truly value, rather than wasting it on a false insurance policy. learn to accept uncertainty about your health. revel in not knowing when or how the end will come. focus instead on the time between now and then. ultimately, what you have to decide is which epitaph you would prefer when your inevitable end arrives lived decades in misery and fear of death, or didnt see that coming but my life was far richer for it.",Anxiety

20867,"apologies for length. there is a lot to explain and i just. need to vent, need a hug, and need someone to tell me things will be okay.i miss my friends so much.i met them a few years ago, when we started spending every wednesday night at each others' places, seeing each others' faces, laughing, drinking, just. basking in each others' warmth. and they made me feel that i was understood. that i finally had a space with them to be myself. they made me feel like i was worth something. starting march of last year, we had to stop getting together for the thenforeseeable future, for obvious reasons. we still talked to each other every weds night with voice chat, played games with each other, all of that. we did not stop being friends. honestly, i do not know what shape i or they would be in if we had not had that solution. it was the best anyone could have done.but. well.i do not. love myself very much. hardly at all, really.it is genetics. i have major depression and anxiety from my mom and dad. i have asd formerly asperger's. and i have been told by my family that even very early on, i was withdrawn from and overwhelmed by the world. i had trouble trying to accomplish things, because i was convinced it would only end in failure.it is also trauma. my mother ran away from the family for a month or two when i was a toddler. her emotions were unstable and i had to learn to walk on eggshells and preempt her anger or disappointment by treating her well. my dad struggled with alcoholism though does not anymore and got in accidents. my parents had lots of shouting matches. i was molested by two separate neighbors when i was 7 or 8. at 14 i was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes after struggling with nausea, headaches, and spontaneous bedwetting which certainly did not help my middleschooler dignity for months. shortly after that diagnosis, my parents divorced. for years after, i had to act as their intermediary, which was extremely stressful since i feared both of them for different reasons. and so on. and so on. for the record, my relationship with both of my parents is much, much better today. they have owned up to their mistakes and are better people now.i think all of that has taught me that i am not worth loving. that others matter more. that i am best served by making others happy.when my friends and i had to stop seeing each other, i did not lose them. but. i think i did lose some parts of those relationships faces to read, positions relative to one another in physical space that provided me with a sense of worthiness and validation that i otherwise. was not capable of providing myself.over the course of covid, we continued to have voice chats and play games together on wednesday nights. but i began to act differently. i started going on about how lonely i was. even right after those nights, on my private twt account which they all followed, i made those sorts of comments. about how sad and hopeless i was. almost as if i were accusing them of not doing enough, when in reality we were doing all we could and all we would ever agreed to do.when i saw them sometimes get together online without me, i reacted in similar ways. even though some of them had been friends before i ever entered the picture. even though their hanging out outside of the group's wednesdays had nothing to do with excluding me and everything to do with them being good friends with each other.throughout all of this, i was feeling down about my job. i would been there for more than six years, but my pay had hardly gotten any higher, and covid reduced the inoffice staff which i was a part of to a skeleton crew. i hardly spoke a word to anyone over the course of a day anymore, because there just were not many people to speak words to. i was losing motivation and hope.in april of this year, i applied for a new job that paid better and looked doable, and received a response and interview very quickly. this should have been a red flag, but i ended up accepting the role and giving my two weeks' notice.the week i was to start this new job, i had two more days at the old position to train my replacement. but. i would never trained anyone before. and we did not have any training resources to speak of. and the senior staff were still almost never in. and my coworker very plainly stated that they did not want to help with the training. and after two hours with the new hire, i would exhausted what little i would been able to prepare. and i excused myself to the bathroom. and i excused myself from the building. and i had a panic attack up the car garage elevator. and i went home and tried to sleep and tried to ignore my phone and continued to panic.and then i started in the new job. and while i understood the role to be clerical, the first half of the day was warehouse work. and i was horrified that i would been placed in the wrong position. the second half of the day, once the financial controller was able to get away from their desk, was indeed training on the clerical role. but it was so nuanced, and touched on so many points so randomly. and the building was scary, clearly built for a staff of a couple dozen but currently hosting only four, including the owner.for a week this carried on, and i panicked and had sobbing fits and thoughts of selfharm scde every single night. i would never experienced anything like it before.after that week, and after discussing it with friends and family. i resigned. it was just affecting me so dramatically that continuing on was not an option.while this was going on, i asked my friends for support and advice, which they graciously gave me. but i was also. up at odd hours, especially once i would resigned, continuing to panic. and i poked at my friends. asked them for more attention and support than they would already given. more than they could reasonably give. i gave them stupid little updates on my state of mind. it was the sort of behavior i would been engaging in with them for a while now, amped up to 200.and it broke. and they told me how i was being. that i was triggering them with my behavior. that i was piling way, way too much onto them.and i felt awful. i would never meant to hurt them. they mattered so, so much to me, and i was being shitty. emotionally manipulative. i think i loved myself so little that i was trying to get all of my validation and comfort from them, especially at my most desperate. and a person cannot give that much to you. it is not physically or emotionally possible. so. i spoke to them in voice chat. apologized. they took my apology, and asked me to move on and be better.so. that is what i have been doing. i started therapy. started learning to be more selfreliant. to love myself more, because i wanted to be a better friend, and because in the times i would not be able to receive love from them, i would be able to get it from somewhere. to not doubt myself so much. and, by extension, to not doubt my friends and how their behavior was or was not connected to me my selfworth so much. to fight against intrusive thoughts of my worthlessness. to be my own friend.i have had some success. i have made some steps. i am proud of what i have accomplished, even if it is only been a short while. i am definitely in a better place than i was two or three months ago.but.i still miss my friends' faces and places and laughing and drinking and warmth. because regardless of my own strength, they give me. tons more. and because i love them and their personalities and just being with them and sharing with them.and recently two of them said they are going to be so busy these next two weeks that they will not even be able to voice chat like normal, and. i am just scared and lonely.and my birthday's at the end of the month, and i am worried i will be spending it alone. they all have spouses, but all i have got is me. and while i am more comfortable with that today, it is still. not much yet. and i. want to be happy. i want a happy birthday. i have been so sad with very little break for months and months now. i want my friends back. i want to be happy. and maybe it is childish but i just want someone to hug me and tell me it is going to be okay.if you have. any kind words, or anything, i would really appreciate it. i really am doing better than i was, but that does not mean i do not stumble, and i am struggling right now.regardless, thank you for reading all of this. because of my behavior over the past year, it would not be right to bring up every detail of this with my friend group. but i still want someone to see it.thank you. struggling with loneliness and selflove cw mention of sexual trauma",Depression

months ago i had a viral infection which has since caused whatever chronic condition or disease i have. just want to add, my viral infection started with a bad stomachlower abdomen ache 12 days before the actual infection 8 months ago, and i had a rapid heartrate from right at the start of the viral infection. my symptoms are just want to start off by saying my heartrate was high right from the very start of whatever infection i got, like from day 1. tachycardia throughout the day. little things make my heart race whereas before i was very fit, i wear a fitbit and my heartrate is very normal in the 60s when i am sleeping. but in the day time, when i am out, even if i am just seating my heartrate is constantly around 110 bpm. and if i have anxiety it can easily go up to 140. and if i, for example, climb the stairs or jump around a bit, my heartrate shoots up to 150, and if i go for a short jog i can't because of my heart, but in 1 minute it is nearly 180 bpm. due to how fast it beats i do not take part in any exercise. i had normal echocardiogram, and ekg. but i did that 5 months ago. i want to point out, for some reason when i am with my family at home my heartrate is also normal if i am just seating. and it was also normal when i visited my cousins and when i was in their house, again just sitting. recently i had to attend a science lab for my university, and even though i was sitting my heartrate was consistently around 110125. my systolic blood pressure has been evaluated since this chronic condition. at 130140, but my diastolic pressure has remained 80. lately, my chest feels more pressure and stress, and i think its because i put alot of strain on my heart throughout the duration of this whole thing. i visited a cardiologist 5 months ago and he said my heart everything was good. for the past few days, it feels if i breath in very deeply my heart hurts, but not really sure where the pain is coming from my only blood abnormality is a very high b12 at more than double the upper limit, 1476 pmoll. i have measured homocysteine just now, and it was in the normal range at 9 umoll. not really sure why my b12 is very high, as i am not taking supplements and am a vegetarian. my hands for nearly 8 months have blue veins appearing on the finger. very similar to the hand in this photo but on the finger aswell . i had muscle twitching and tingling which happened alot throughout the day, it has since gone down, but the tingling and twitching still happen at times. i had a normal emg. leg muscles have gotten much weaker according to my wallsit time and squatting. prior to 8 months i could easily do a wall sit for 3 minutes, now after 20 seconds my legs feel unbearably sore, and they are shaking like crazy right away when i start a wall sit. normal tests and results all this are from several months ago, except the blood results posted above, those are from today. normal tsh, blood cbc, ldh, esr, crp, protein electrophoresis, abdomen ultrasound , echocardiogram, emg test, urine analysis, ebv, bicarbonate, chloride, creatinine , ast alt, potassium. abnormal results very high blood b12 1475 pmoll range is 200600 pmoll. slightly low iron and vitamin d. i do not take any b12 supps when it was measured high, and i am also a vegetarian. to summarize i feel i have some type of postviral autoimmune disease which causes high b12, tachycardia, anxiety, and highnormal neutrophils and monocytes. but i really have no idea what it is, or if it is even an autoimmune disease, etc. thank you for taking the time to read and help me out. it is very

my dad tried hard, he was educated with multiple degrees, and he failed. there was so many humiliating moments in my life where he would beg for money in front of me, and sometimes even using me to beg. he would sing along to bruno mars' i want to be a billionaire in the car, threw a temper tantrum to my aunts and uncles demanding the bonus money one of my uncle's received because he was his former coworker before he was fired, had screaming fits of rage when my uncle and cousin did not loan him money he needed, brought my brother and i along to ask some guy of our ethnicity for a financial favor, etc. i believed every excuse he made when he quit working somewhere. i believed i could never do it, and i hated how my parents acted like i could. after all, i was just like my dad, as my mom would say.i barely passed high school. i think all throughout high school, i never studied once, except maybe some french vocabulary once in awhile. i never studied after high school, either. i hated how my family treated me like some genius because i wrote bad poetry in middle school they never knew what my actual grades were like. i thought i was going to kill myself by age 18 anyway, so high school did not matter. all i cared about in high school was friends, which i did not really have. i had two friends from middle school that went to other high schools, and i was not allowed to see them for the most part. i saw them a handful of times throughout high school, after months or years of begging. my parents never let me leave the house, not even for walks. why? for my safety, which they never actually cared about. the real reason was because only bad girls did that, according to my mom. bad girls are her word for whores. she would call little girls playing in their front yards bad girls, and teenage girls out walking together bad girls. i was so desperate to be away from my parents, that i would go on walks alone near my school just to not go home. there was nothing much to see, and no one to spend time with i just could not stand my life of school and home, school and home. school where i would be alone at lunch, and home where i would be alone and have to listen to my parents screaming fits.i never thought my family of aunts and uncles and cousins loved each other i thought it was all just a fake performance, because that is how my mom would treat it. i would finally allow myself to relax around my family, and then i would notice my mom glowering at me with complete and utter hate, whispering hateful words toward me. after the family gathering, she would tell me what terrible crimes i committed on the way home not making enough eye contact, not saying hello properly, acting like a freak. she was just trying to help me, of course. i just did not realize how much i was embarrassing myself, after all.i also needed to realize how much i was embarrassing myself by thinking people actually wanted to spend time with me, too. one time i lied about getting tutoring so i could spend an hour after school with an acquaintance. my parents cut my time with her short by lying about calling the police. around the time, my mom asked me i really thought people wanted to be around me, and told me i am embarrassing myself going after people. she did the same thing when, after several years of begging, she let me visit my friend at age 17 whom i had known since middle school and who lived only a few minutes drive away, for an hour. it felt so good, i did not want to leave. i ignored my mom's texts for maybe 20 minutes, and again, she lied about having called the police and telling them that my friend was a rape victim. she spat in my face and locked me out of the house at night. why? because i worried her so much, and i did not even look like i was sorry.i attempted suicide when i was 17. in the psychiatric hospital, my mom humiliated me by openly wondering if maybe i did it because of my acne. but still, i was not as hopelessly sad as i am now. maybe i would have been able to be a normal person, if it were not for what happened when i was 18. i was raped by an almoststranger who worked at my community college, and made the mistake of telling one of my cousins. she had felt guilty for excluding me from her friendship circle with my other cousins, and had told me that she would be there for me after she learned about the attempted suicide when i was 17. so i told her, and she told her dad and then ignored me. her dad told my other uncle, and then they told my parents. my family is religious, and they blamed me, except for my dad. that was the worst time of my life. i was forced to tell the police, who asked me questions about if i was a virgin before and how many times did i have sex. i received letters from the community college saying it was likely consensual, and the guy never lost his job. i checked his facebook a couple months ago, and he is doing just great. my mom severely emotionally abused me for the incident ever since. my dad, who my uncles call the best father because whereas they would have disowned me, he did not. forced me to go to that same community college everyday until the end of the semester. because he cared about my future, of course. and i guess my safety too. i have this distinct memory of me being desperate to leave my front door, just for a walk on a sunny day. he physically held me back, saying it is not safe. but i guess i was safe going there everyday, and i could definitely do well too, right? no. i muddled along for the next two years, not doing anything of substance, and then my dad commit suicide.i think i got over the bereavement stage of my dad's suicide very quickly. he was very loving, but that is not good enough for me. i was always, always uncomfortable around him. he was severely mentally ill, and i took the brunt of it. the best dad would not have strangled me for not drinking enough water for his liking. he felt love for me, sure, and i knew that, but he was never able to express it properly. that will never be good enough for me. my mom then spent several months blaming me for it, saying that my dad did it because he knew my rape was actually consensual, etc.at the age of 21, i finally transferred from community college to university, despite only having done 58 of the required 60 units, not even enough to apply for an associate's degree. i thought maybe my life could finally improve. but it did not. i am still the same directionless, lazy piece of shit. i flunked all of my classes, and now i am taking a semester off, but i will probably disenroll from university entirely. my bank account will likely be closed in two days, because i have had a negative balance for two months. instead of getting a job, i ignored the issue, expecting my mom to pick up the pieces. but i am 22 and she is tired of having to take care of me. i do not even resent her for it, her being emotionally abusive is not an excuse for me to be a parasite. other people are motivated by emotional abuse to escape their situation, for me all i do is sit and cry about it.so much other shit happened to me, it would just be too long to write it all. i only wrote what i did to explain most of the reasons why i am depressed, but now, my whole debt issue and failure at everything is my main issue. i am afraid. i had an interview today, but i rescheduled it, because i am afraid. i never grew up and i do not want to, i just want to disappear. i have been waiting for someone to save me i guess, someone to take care of me like i feel i need to be taken care of, but i will not even be taken care of financially anymore. i am 22, in debt, have never worked a real job, do not have a driver's license, and am a soon to be college dropout",Depression

did not look at her whatsapp i just tried to forget her around day ago in a moment of weakness i searched her name and see that she ha blocked me on whatsapp i didn t even do anything after she said all that i got very depressed and wrote her a long message on text this wa the message hello please read this that is my only request yesterday i had tried to message you on whatsapp asking how you were and saw that you have blocked me you can block me here and everywhere else a well after this i just want you to read what wa in my mind when we were talking from the day we had started talking i do not know what all bad thing you think about me but atleast from my side i had always wanted to be a good friend and never had any bad thought i had fun on each of our meeting i have been continuously thinking for the last month what did i do wrong a you never told me and just shut me off maybe these were the reason i don t even know i can t even think properly i thought that we were very alike i honestly thought we could be good friend two introvert who want to be better at their craft and helping each other out through tough school again i do not know what all notion you had about my intention but i did not want to be more than friend if you ever felt that way i am a new guy in this country there are many thing i have not even understood here having a relationship or a girlfriend is the last thing on my mind i don t even have friend here to share stuff so i never wanted anything more than just being friend who could help each other whenever they needed or share thing about life course maybe take some advice on what to do in certain aspect of life thing that normal friend do and maybe i wa selfish to have looked for that friend in you you had said that i did not deserve to be a friend the last time we talked there ha not been a day when i did not think what did i do wrong that i am not even worth a friendship i think that i had probably messaged you more than what you wanted a a friend i don t know you never told me that i thought everything wa normal whenever something came to my mind or i watched some video that i liked on youtube i used to send it to you i think i should not have done that and maybe you didn t like that i just did that because i wanted to share thing with you that i admired so that those thing may bring happiness to you a well the other reason wa that i looked at your painting on instagram i am sorry that i looked at your instagram profile to appreciate your painting i did not have any wrong intention i wa just curious and had thought you would like it a you had said that you like it when your friend appreciate your art i wa not aware of internet persona being different from real life persona i am not a bad person i just wanted to be a friend and someone you could trust i am not writing this to you for any response or for being friend because i don t think i have any respect in your eye and i have lost much of my self respect in my own eye after how many time i have tried to apologize honestly for last week i didn t even look for you on whatsapp a it wa soul crushing to read how you had said that i blew the chance of being a friend and i think it is best that you do not respond to me a i can not feel more pathetic and worse about myself trying to mend the bridge which never even existed i just want to say that i am sorry if i ever hurt you or made you feel bad i always wanted to be good and make you happy a a friend i never had any malice or any bad intention i never wanted to be someone who you despise this much i am just sorry and i will be really grateful if you could just let me know what i did i texted her this and and then she texted back don t say if own up to your mistake and now she will block me in text a well i am not even sure what i did and i feel depressed lonely and sad i have never felt like this,Depression

7361,"how i lost my dad3 years ago, when i was 13 years old, my dad got in to a really bad accident. my dad who was a big sportsman was cycling home from work while training for a upcoming triathlon. unfortunately he got by a drunk driver and broke his neck, skull, spine and almost everything you can think of. when i visited him in the hospital after his crash it was one of the most painful things i have ever seen. seeing my dad laying on his bed crying because he tried staying strong for us but could not keep it together. i had never felt so powerless. in the following months after the accident, we all had faith my dad would become the man he used to be. the man who always was the guy i could on. the man who was always supporting me on the sideline, but unfortunately the situation grew worse as he got diagnosed with a serieus brain injury. he had to accept he had lost it all. his work he could not and still cannot, his sports cycling, running, swimming and his dream of finishing an iron man one of the toughest sport races in the world. with my mom working full time and my 2 brothers being away from home a lot he did not have a shoulder to cry on most of the time. while at the time we all had hope his brain injury would start to decrease, the only thing i can hope for now is that my family stays together. because of my dad being home for most of the time and being in a mostly depressed state, he is sleeping a lot the time and draining the energy of all of the family members. while we all love him as much as we did before the accident, the suffering of both ends is coming to a point where the bubble will burst. the pain i am suffering is in no way compatible with the pain of losing your whole life. but losing your dad while your sitting right next to him hits you in a weird way. he cannot take much and gets extremely angry at my mom about the smallest things, while the only thing she deserves is love and appreciation. right now i feel like i have lost the man who was on my side for the biggest part of my life. how i lost my dad",Depression

17100,"hi. thanks for reading this. i am 21f. i just failed my first year of college because i missed too many assignments. it was the result of a mixture of things including learning being entirely online and my lack of motivation. i had a meeting with an advisor who asked me flat out, is this the right life path for you right now? to which i replied, i do not know but i do not have a choice either way. to explain, before i came to university halls i lived with my parents in a one bedroom apartment. i slept in their living room for a year after i had to drop out of college the first time. this is my second stab at it. i know they say third time's the charm but this is getting ridiculous now. i dropped out the first time for mental health issues. i have failed this year for the same reason. i knew i probably was not ready for university yet, but all i could think about was getting out of my parents' house. it was the easiest route to take in order for that to happen. my mother's a hoarder, and both of my parents are emotionally unavailable and have a history of being abusive.living alone, i fair much, much better mentally but still not at a functioning level. if i am dysfunctional living alone, then living with my parents i am actively suicidal. i have attempted before under their roof. i could not even tell them about it. i called the ambulance myself and left in it without them even waking up. i have had friends' parents pick me up off of overpasses and asking me why are not your parents out looking for you?the thing is the dream of getting away from abuse is not all rosy. once you are away from it, you need to know how to function and i cannot do that. i do not think i am good enough at anything to do a degree in anything. i have tried three different fields. i hate myself to my absolute core. i hate my apathy regarding my life and everything around me. i hate my laziness and my seemingly inability to just be a responsible adult. i feel like a child. i do not feel like i ever had the opportunity to be a kid in my abusive household and now i have to fend for myself like i have been doing my whole life. i am tired. i just want it to stop. my situation rn is dire. my bank balance is in the negatives and by the end of the month i will have nowhere to live. i have applied for jobs and am hoping to hear back. financial benefits even if i did qualify for them will not even cover the rent in the area where i live. i do not know what to do. it is looking likely i will have to move back home temporarily for two months and know full well i will be actively suicidal for that time and then try to repeat the year.my advisor is worried this is not the right life path for me, but i do not have the money to live alone right now outside of studying. i am relying heavily on my student loan which will be paid in september to get me by. i am an idiot so do not have savings. i have been disassociated for days and just feel trapped. i wish i was just good enough to do this degree and be responsible. i wish i could take care of myself. i am a bad person and i have hurt so many people so i do not even have any friends right now besides my best friend. i deserve to die. i have nothing to live for. there is not hope. i wish i could just have help and i guess for most people that comes from their parents but i just cannot. i do not have that. i am 21 and need to fend for myself and i cannot even do that properly.i do not know what i enjoy or what i am good at which makes making any decision impossible. it is why school was great for me. i got told what to do. ever since i left, i have had absolutely no clue what to do with my life. i know it sounds stupid but it is so scary being an adult and i do not know how to do it. i turned 21 just this month and i do not feel any older than 17. i am not sure how to move forward. i do not expect anyone to know either. i guess i am just looking for support. i do not know how i can go on.thanks for reading. 21f college student at a loss of how to move forward",Suicidal

today and let me begin explain stuff. i am not good at explaining things, forgive me.i was that toxic, ugly, awkward kid you most hate in middle school. i could not talk with people before that time then i got the courage to be myself for some reason when i was 13, then i became the most toxic person you would see. problem is, my actions are stupid. i really do not know what i am doing. i act like a 2 year old child. my selfish feelings was at its peak, i always acted like my body is not there, sure they can hear me but they could not see my weird actions. people see me as a weirdo, they hate me and i did not care like that is their fault. then when i reached 15, something happened. like i realized everything. my stupid talk, actions, trying to be funny stuff etc. i never had a best friend until that age. i met someone. she liked me and i loved her. i was still acting stupid and weird. but i was going down. then that day when my parents made me lock myself in some room, hurt myself and cry like a baby. again. my dad was kicking the door and yelling me open the door. it was happening since i was a child. it was because i did not wanted to go out. i was so anxious that someone see me and recognize from school. i was going outside with a jacket even in summer. then my mother picked the lock and they saw me trying to peel my face off with my nails lol. days later we went a psychiatrist and he told my parents that i was afraid of people seeing my richard in my pants. we took another psychiatrist. paid so well and went outside of the city for that. diagnosed me with depression and social anxiety. i was on some medicine from that time. he asked me if sometimes i wish to be dead. i said sometimes. he wanted some tests, brain scan, blood etc. i could not give blood because i am scared of needles. and it is not like oh that is going to hurt, its more like i can cut my arm open with a chainsaw if you want, just do not put that needle on my skin. i grew with needles as a child. he said all the tests are ok and told me my parents that i am psychotic or something. a month later my depression was pretty much gone. but in that month, i tried to suicide 2 times. and it all went wrong. these were my first times i hurt my first best friend. i had no friends but her. then i apologized so much for thinking about suicide etc. that is the moment where walter became heisenberg. i was so toxic smallest problem would grow up like a huge rock and i was thinking about suicide and crying. i gave up meds, every week i was taking handful of ssris trying to die in sleep. it did nothing except destroying my stomach and sleep. i was talking so negative but selfish with her. she were trying to support me and she were crying with me sometimes. and i started to use it to feed my ego. everytime i got sad, i cried like a baby and she hug me in whatsapp. i became so toxic, everytime she say how are you, i was saying i want to die. it took months but she finally had enough. she were saying ok go ahead and do what you want. i always felt as i love her so much but she is seeing me just like anyone else. even she says opposite. i was afraid of asking that if she care about me sometimes and from that days i went into full time job asking her if she still care about me 12 hours. of course she started to ignore me. and i was aware of it. it went even worse, i was being hostile if she says yes instead yess. hours later i find myself apologizing to the rest of the day. this took months. my family finally knew i had a friend. they of course, do not like me having friends like they did when i was a kid. they were like ok but anytime they see me talk with her, they were saying that friendships end after sometime, its nothing important in your life, go study. oh also i never gave a sht about school since 8th grade. i was afraid of being seen, closed my instagram, snapchat yeah ugly people use it too and removed people in whatsapp. i was ignoring my meds and my social anxiety was still there. i think it is genetic, since my father has the same issue and my little brother, when i go out, my body starts to shake, my eyes could not find a spot to look at and i sweat a lot. when i try to talk i did not know what to say, my voice never go loud enough. this is another problem. if i cannot go out, i will not find a job, i cannot go to school, i cannot have fun outside being social as a teen etc. this is the point where i am now at my 90's waiting for god to end my life. my life is just stopped. i am lying at the bed in home all day. and parents yell at me all time for it but who cares. people do not like me when i am outside, they would laugh me, follow me i was even afraid of someone would go hurt me outside. i was closing every window at home so no one would see me. still, we were friends. my only fun times, talking her, calling someone for first time, playing games, laughing, talking about other people, having fun. but oh, gray ticks. and she is online. oh yeah, she never loved me, i am nothing for her. why not go shot myself in the head right. this went for a loong time. i could not stop myself acting that toxic. its like, everything makes sense at that moment. you been lied. she is just making fun of you. hours later, i cry, apologize and the day is over. and maximum a week later, it happens again for some reason. she had enough. it was my last time doing it. i swore that i would never act like that again. and i never acted like that again. but i was still feeling it. i was trying to hold myself till it all becomes colorful again. then we met. in real life. went to their house, met their parents, went to the beach, took photos etc. it was my best day in my whole life. i am in love with her i think i must accept that. oh btw we had an ig account for me, but we both use it. its still active. we post stories etc. we could not wait to do it again. but she has another friends. it was still hurting me to see her with her friends. i would ask if she love them more than me if it was a year ago, but i got over it. that hostility feeling was always there. but i tried to hold it. sometimes i could not held and we fight again, eh. i fight again, but we were good. untillll. today. it is special day or something next week, we was going to meet again in hers. the day started all good. she were online, not answering. i did not said anything about it, then she said sorry, i was texting in group, did not saw your message i said its ok. we talked, laughed and while we talk, my brain is like oh she were talking to another friend, she does not like you, you think she is having fun talking with you? after everything you have done? she was having fun talking me sometimes. only sometimes. i could not hold it and said if you were talking with someone else you can tell me, no need to hide its ok, those days are over. she said that she is not lying, but i could not believe it. i had no ability to let myself think about it for a moment, and i were saying no need to hide etc. she went offline for 2 hours, i cried cried and she finally replied. she said that she would forgive me if i shut up. i said ok but at least tell me are we completely fine? she said . my pain was at its peak. i told her at least tell me are we going to be fine again, i feel so bad etc. she said no, i do not care about you, real friend would not let me hurt, fill me with complete negativity everyday, i do not love you anymore, you hurt me and i still talk with you. just shut up we cannot be fine anymore. i paralyzed for a moment and asked her give me one last chance, and i will change, i will not hurt her anymore. she said ok, and now we are fine i guess. umm, people, i am not going to change. i am toxic af, i do not deserve to be alive, or live life like others. i mean it, its nothing like oh help me help me, should i die, yes yes i die please make me not die.i have one last chance. i have 2 options. first one is. suicide. i would never ever hurt her again, i would not worry about my bad look, my future, my past, people etc. but my family would hurt along with her. she would not feel that much i think but still my family would fell down with my death. actually, only my mother and brother would. but they did not like the way i go. and if i cannot change myself, i will already kill myself at somepoint. they know that. second option is risking it. trying to change. i cannot meditate to change my personality and focus in my breathing. it is like faking it. it does not feel well. i cannot take therapy as i hate doctors as they just put me on a different ssri and anti psychotic. also do not have money for that. no, i just do not want to take therapy, it feels wrong. feels like it will not help. i feel like i cannot change.any options other than suicide you see? any suggestions? i do not know i just wanted to explain things. please do not tell me stop talking with her, i cannot. i love her more than anything. i am sorry i am being such a toxic asshole but i could even leave my family for her. except sometimes. sometimes i hurt her and myself with my feelings. but i still cannot give up of her. i love her more than anything, and i want she if not the same, just love me like she do others. but sometimes my brain says she never loved me.i am not feeling much atm, i just wish i was never born. please say something, i like to talk. i do not know, convince me to suicide if its ok here, or do the opposite with the reasons. tell me i am the most toxic asshole you ever heard of. i do not

35120,"i keep losing my ability to sneeze ok, this is a very bizarre one, but i've been suffering from this issue on and off for over two years, and it's having a big impact on my life. it'd be great if someone is able to shed some light on this. i keep losing the ability to sneeze. basically, i'll get to the ahh, but the choo won't happen. i'm not 100 sure, but i think it all started when i had some kind of allergic reaction to something in 2016, and i found myself unable to sneeze for at least three weeks. during that time, i had quite bad headaches and head pressure. when i finally sneezed, the pain instantly disappeared. ampx200b since then, the problem keeps coming back, along with the head painpressure i mentioned earlier. i think the longest i've gone without sneezing naturally is three months. strangely, i can force myself to sneeze by tickling the inside of my nostrils with a pointy tissue, but that doesn't seem to relieve the head pain. however, i can occasionally sneeze if i think about something erotic and fortunately that does relieve the head pain! ampx200b i've researched this problem countless times and i read somewhere that inability to sneeze could be the sign of a brain tumour, which seems very unlikely because i would also have more serious symptoms, such as an inability to yawn or swallow, which i can do perfectly fine. also, the fact that i'm able to force myself to sneeze surely means there's nothing seriously wrong? ampx200b i also read that it could instead be a psychological problem, and i honestly think that could be right sometimes, when i feel a sneeze coming on, it'll come out fine when i'm having a conversation with somebody, so it could be that it helps to be distracted from the sneeze instead of worrying about it. i would also like to mention that looking at the light in my bedroom sometimes makes the sneeze come out at the last second, despite the fact that i don't think i have the photic sneeze reflex i.e. ability to sneeze without fail by looking at a bright light. ampx200b plucking my nose hairs can also make me sneeze, but i tried that a few days ago and it didn't work. now i'm sneezestuck again. hoping someone can help! thanks.",Anxiety

11305,"my so was my driving force, but they turned out to be dating me out of pity. they were hiding the fact that they were aromantic from me because they felt bad that i was so excited to be with them. were still best friends its hard to break a friendship of almost 3 years, but now i feel like a burden to them. i felt so happy with them. its the first time i felt loved or cared about. i even received my first compliment on my looks from them. my world came crashing down when i learned this was all hollow and insincere. i cannot begin to tell you how happy i was when they said i love you too. now its the opposite because they just did that to make me feel appreciated. the first compliment i received in my life on my looks turned out to be the same story. i was so ecstatic to hear that i am pretty, but that feeling is gone since that was just a hollow compliment that meant nothing. i finally started to feel good about my looks after they told me i am pretty, but now i do not even want to post my face anymore. i feel like a burden to them now. this made my mental state go to shit, and now they have to deal with me like that. i still love chatting and calling with them even though i cry every time i do. they are the only thing keeping me going right now. they are still my driving force. without them, i cannot say id be alive right now.note please do not get mad at them for not telling me about being aromantic. they feel like absolute shit for not telling me in the first place and profusely apologized. they also were in major denial when they noticed they were aromantic and saw our relationship as a way to try and be normal being aro is completely normal and okay by the way. they soon started to feel sick for not telling me this and felt terrible after noticing they should not of forced a relationship on themself. this was all caused because they tried to suppress their actual feelings without immediately noticing it and me jumping into this way too fast which is not their fault, so i do not want any hate directed toward them in the comments. i feel unwanted",Suicidal

25604,"this post is pretty much me trying to put abstract thoughts into words, so this may not make much sense or be in a logical order.i cannot make any sense of my thoughts or emotions. for as long as i can remember my general mood has been following a set pattern, where for a few months my emotions would generaly be happier and the next few months sader. it would not be an extreme difference, but noticeable at night while trying to sleep. since i started highschool 2019 every few cycles there is a period of about a month where i feel sader than a normal sad period. i originally attributed this to the increased stress and left it at that. but midway though the great year that was 2020 i began having a small, very faint feeling that i just did not want to exist anymore. this was during a particularly bad sad period. this would because alarm bells to ring in anyone, but i knew i would not act on these thoughts due to my life philosophy. my general approach to life is to impact other people's lives positively, and to try and limit anyall negative impact. now here is the main problem with everything. i will not tell anyone like my parents i have had any form of suicidal thoughts, because that would because them pain, and if i did act on it, then they would feel like they failed and should have done more. it would because them guilt that they did not see anything before. i just do not want to risk them being hurt. for that same reason i cannot risk hurting them if i act. so i cannot do anything.now i have just left my current period of sad, so i feel i have the ability to prosses my thoughts a bit more rationally. this period felt worse, and for about a week i could not draw my attention away from the feeling.but i might not be really suicidal like i said, bad order because almost every time i imagined or dreamed myself jumping off a building there was always someone else there, trying to talk me out of it. this is what confuses me, and why i cannot tell if i am really depressedsuicidal or this is just some twisted attempt my subconscious is devising to draw peoples attention to me.i would never attempt anything currently, i do not want to hurt anyone around me. but i am just worried if the current trend continues i do not know what i might do.because i have no idea if i am blowing nothing out of proportion i have not told anyone. i will not drag anyone else into my issues. councilors would tell my parents due to the potential severity.so to summarize, i might be depressed yet cannot act on it, or i could be not and just attention seeking. i do not know if putting my thoughts here is also me just attention seeking. i just do not know.can anyone relate to or prosses these thoughts better than i can?am i mentally ok? i cannot make any sense of my thoughts or emotions",Depression

14933,"in my last post i complained about how rude he is in, everything he does. now, i am beginning to understand exactly why! when, his wife was alive, she had control over everything. he had very little if any control at all. so, in the scant few years he says he has left, he is trying to make up for 47 years of being someone who always did as he was told. here is the issue, nothing i do is good enough for him. except maybe the physical things he cannot do at all anymore. for example yardwork. anything my wife or i do around here, he goes behind us and quietly second guesses. if the cat is outside, he insists he knows about it! i asked why? one of us let her out, one of us will let her back in. nope. not good enough for him! he goes out onto the concrete porch on very shaky legs in, clumsy slippers and, down the brick steps to get her. why? you guessed it! he has to control the cat too! if any of you have ever had a cat or two you are all aware that cats do as they please! when, we moved in here, he insisted we change anything we did not like after all this will be our house soon then when, we talk about changing anything or buying something new, he scoffs! idk why your going to waste money on a new tv when, this 28 year old, 19 box tv is just fine! oh, you mean the one with the lousy picture that you always complain about having to get up to see the program guide because, you cannot see it? that perfectly fine tv? i mention to him that we are getting a new kitchen trash can because the one he has is not designed to hold trash. we have no room for it in the kitchen and.you guessed it! the old one is perfectly fine! plenty of room for it and, the old one is not perfectly fine! we want to replace the shades with blinds, he says why? the old ones are perfectly fine! not true. every one of them is torn and, the springs are shot. my wife his daughter hung out his humming bird feeder. we went and bought a second one and since my wife cannot get on a ladder nor can i she mounted it in a lower area. day before yesterday, he had dragged out the ladder to climb up and put the feeder up higher. he was wearing house slippers and his robe. he could have fallen and at his age, that would be the end. oh i almost forgot the most important part. the lower feeder was not his idea. that is why he wanted to move it. he wanted us here so badly and said do whatever you want but is now regretting saying it. why? because he is not in charge. we have had to be careful when we go food shopping because, he has talked about, how much he misses driving. he has trouble hearing, we almost have to yell to get a point across he cannot see the cat, his phone, his walker, etc, when they right in front of him! no way, he is going to drive! all that being said, can someone please explain to me how a 94 year old man, has such a fucking obsession with being in control? you would think, his chief priority would be staying alive as long as he can! he frustrates the shit out of me, that pisses me off and, then i get so depressed that, i want to sleep all day! in any event, thanks for reading my rant. hope all is well. love and an awesome day to everyone! so says the godfather! lol controlling",Depression

23135,"i do not know what to do. i have been depressed and anxious for about 6 months now. the last time i was depressed i was a 16 year old kid who was scared about what was to come in life. i cut my wrist when my parents were not home. my brother took me to the hospital. i did not have any friends at the time. i did not talk much with my family either. i somehow picked my self up and started working out and focusing on school. i got better. i was completely out of depression. but it is back now and the working out and focussing on work thing does not work anymore. i am very angry about covid. i only got to stay 6 months away from home in my college where i had full freedom, before it was all stolen away and i had to come back home. my house is comfortable and i have the privilege of privacy in my own room, good food, etc. i had a boyfriend when the pandemic started. we were incredibly close. i loved him more than anything in the world and i know he loved me too. when the pandemic started we were not able to meet. so we texted a lot. we were also horny so we sexted a lot too. the sexts got extreme over a few weeks when one day he made up a sext story about raping me. that scared the shit out of me. i trusted him with anything and everything and this was the last thing i expected from him. i told him that and he apologized but the story kept eating me. if he could think all that then he might do it too? i told myself and him that we love each other and just need some time to get over this. but i could not get over it, i tried to continue loving him but it was gone. i was repulsed by the very touch of him. i had to break up. i started talking to a guy who i used to hook up with. we started hooking up again and we got very close. but the whole staying at home thing was getting the best of me and i became very irritable and i picked on small things and fought a lot. one of those fights got intense and he told me we were done. i could not take it. i could not fathom the thought of being alone again. i did not have any other people who i could be remotely close with. i fought more and begged him and fought more. in one of the fights he told me that he only cared about the sex and everything else was just stupid. that hurt me because i had started to fall for him and i wanted to date him. i cried some more and told myself to stay away. but two days later he texts me asking me to be his girlfriend. he apologized for the things he said and told me that he did not mean any of it. i said yes. we have been dating for a month now and i am not a big fan. he is busy all day with work and gaming at night. he barely texts me and even when he does, there is nothing interesting to talk about. even if we do manage to find a good topic, it feels like he is fighting with me or he just makes jokes on my expense.all of my college work is online and due to these relationship problems and being cooped up in my room, i have not been able to learn much or do good work. i am only getting mediocre marks and doing work just to get it over with. i have days when i am uncontrollably crying all the time. today is one such day. i also have anxiety now. it is very new and scary and exhausting. i do not know how to deal with it. a couple of good things happen every now and then but i am never able to appreciate them. i keep crying about how everything sucks in life. i want someone to help me. i want someone to pick me up and tell me it is going to be okay and that they love me. i do not know where i am going with my career either. my family have started to pressure me into getting married and i do not want to ever get married. i have to move out as soon as i graduate which means i need money. i am working as an intern and getting a little bit of money but if i want to move out soon i will have to make so much more money. the depression and anxiety is sucking the life out of me. all my energy is being used up to stay sane and eat and sleep regularly. i have no energy left to be creative with my work. i keep missing my first boyfriend every now and then. i keep having thoughts about going back to him even tho i cannot stand being intimate with him just because we had some very good times together. he made me feel safe and happy until it ended. i want to learn how to be alone and happy. but i keep seeking support and attention. dating apps are not helping because everyone is way too horny. i have two girlfriends who i talk to every now and then and i have told them everything and they have helped loads. but i cannot seem to be happy. i cannot continue crying to them, it will get very annoying for them. thank you so much for reading this, i feel better typing all this out but i still have no idea what to do to make myself appreciate whatever is available to me. i tried a couple sessions of therapy which did not help much but i cannot afford more. i have to save money to move out and my family cannot help because they will not understand mental issues.i am trying my best to get into hobbies and work out and socialize with people. i just want to learn to enjoy being alone and have energy to do good work. i also want to have good friendships and relationships. i do not want to die, i want things to get better.if you have any advice as to how to handle myself when i am crying uncontrollably hating everybody and calling myself an ugly stupid piece of shit, please let me know. thank you everything that is happening is either sad or boring or scary.",Depression

34400,"i could use some reassurance. swollen lymph node, getting a biopsy friday i have been having reoccurring sinus infections due to a tooth that needed a root canal. during that time, i went to an ent who told me that my nose was a bit crooked and that was another reason. while i was there i thought i'd ask him about a lymph node in the back of my neck. when i first discovered it i thought it was a knot in a muscle so i tried to massage it out but it never went away. eventually, i asked my gp about it and he said not to worry unless it grows. i don't think it has. i told him that it had been there for at least 2 years but more likely 34 years. he asked if it was stable and i said yes but he wanted to get an ultra sound. the ultra sound tech said she thought it was just a lymph node. i asked if she thought there was cancer in it, and she didn't think so but would let my ent make that call. i went to the follow up and he mentioned the ultra sound doctor thinking it was a lymph node but wanted to get a needle point biopsy on it. he said that 910 times it was nothing but he would be a bad doctor if he didn't check. this triggered my health anxiety. what if i'm that 110? my brother had lymphoma when he was 27, and i'm 31. so i'm terrified. i poked it, and it got harder, and my neck got sore, and now i can't stop checking it even though i know i need to. i'm trying not to push on it and just brush my hand across it, but it's still there and it's still freaking me out. a few weeks ago i had a routine physical and my blood work was normal. my white blood cells were high but they were at 8 and the range was 110 was normal. my gp didn't think anything was wrong aside from minor cholesterol stuff that he put me on vitamins for. so i'm getting the biopsy on friday, and following up on wednesday to get the results. but in the meantime i'm spiraling here and looking for reassurance or help. i don't feel sluggish aside from being tired, i have a very active 11 month old baby. my color is good, no fever, no night sweats. i have chest pain but that's just anxiety that comes and goes with my panic attacks. my appetite is fine. my blood work came back fine. i'm over reacting, right?",Anxiety

13237,"so this might be a very weird title, and probably an even weirder story but i am going to share it with you anywaysince 2018 i have been a big fan of a band, iron maiden. you might have heard of them since they are pretty popular. i started listening to this band when i was still in school and decided to go to a concert with my dad which originally would take place in the summer on 2019. now with the corona and all it got postponed to the summer of 2022 already. as of late i feel like i might be obsessed with iron maiden, maybe in a good way but not necessarily. i love their music very much, seen every dvd and love to read interviews and stories about them. iron maiden helped me through a tough time last year when someone very close to me got hospitalised with covid19 and almost died because of it. luckily that person survived and is still with us, which i am grateful for every day of my lifeampx200bbut now the reason why i wanted to share my story in this subreddit iron maiden are a very old band. they have been going since the 80's already and their oldest member is 69 at the moment. i have only become a fan of them in 2018 meaning i missed out on so much. i could not have been there since the beginning since i was born in 1998. but the things i missed make me feel miserable. the great journeys the band had, the amazing adventures they went on and i missed it all.to add to this, they announced a new album coming in september 2021, the 17th album to be exact. rejoice you would say right? well, wrong. i feel very sad and would almost call it depressed. i hardly sleep and i cannot find fun in the little things anymore like playing a game or going on trips with my girlfriend. every time i read something about iron maiden or watch a video dvd i get so sad since they are at the end of their career and i have only been there for such a short while. i want to be so excited for the upcoming album and support the band on perhaps their last tour but i just cannot.i know this probably all sounds very stupid and you are probably scratching your heads on why i make such a big deal out of this. and to be perfectly honest, i am wondering the same thing. i feel so stupid that i feel this way but i do not know what i can do to stop it. the realisation that my favourite band might quit in a few years is something i cannot accept.my girlfriend nor my parents do not really seem to get it either. they know i am an avid iron maiden fan but they do not get why i am so sad when talking about the end of their career. it is not like they make fun of me for feeling this way, it is just like they think it is weird that it means so much to me. i sometimes think i might be autistic since it bothers me this much.ampx200bi do not know if there is any advice that would help me, but i wanted to share my feelings right here. iron maiden will always stay with me but i am so afraid that i might fall in a very deep depression once they announce the end and that is something i do not want. i have a beautiful girlfriend with whom i plan to have children in the future and grow old together. i cannot let them down because of something like this but i am so scared it is going to happen. i feel like i am depressed because of my favourite band",Depression

19849,"on sunday night i tried to kill myself by hanging. i choked until i passed out, and awoke violently gagging i ran to the bathroom and threw up, and spent the rest of my night on the bathroom floor. the next morning, i spent my time walking around like a zombie, and when i got home i thought i wanted to try again i decided to call mental health services and they decided i needed to get myself to the hospital. after realising i am physically ok and there is no permanent damage, i honestly feel lucky to be alive.depression and suicide have surrounded me for the majority of my adulthood. my dad committed suicide when i was 15, and i do not think i ever fully resolved the trauma from that event. i have consistently felt on and off for the past few years, but my suicidal thoughts culminated on sunday night and resulted in me trying to take my own life.my ex girlfriend, who i was with for nearly 6 years, came over and repeatedly twisted and manipulated my feelings to the point where id never felt more sick and used in my life. i begged this person to come back in my life, and i am deeply ashamed not because of showing feelings, but because i now know that this person has never caused me anything but pain. over the years, i feel that she conditioned me into complacency, and gradually tore down my personality into the person who was happy to be stuck with someone like that for the rest of their life. looking back on it now, in a calmer state, and with the perspective that all the loved ones who have come by and supported me have provided, i now realise there is not much of this person i wasted so much time and energy on that actually value or respect. she could not talk or communicate like an adult. she was incapable of seeing the effects of her actions on other people. she was selfish. she made poor decisions, and was incapable of looking after her health and hygiene properly. she had very few friends, and repeatedly drove people away due to her personality. she was always so quick to judge and criticise others, especially me, without ever turning the magnifying glass back on herself. she humiliated my sister about her botched tattoo, despite having an absolute clusterfuck of poorly assembled tattoos mismatched all over her thighs. she hated cheaters and how people functioned in their relationships, yet complained about me to her male friend, and gaslit me into thinking i was crazy for hurting from it. she criticised other peoples health and appearance, yet only continued to gain weight without doing a single thing to change. she often shamed me for how i chose to dress, despite often having pretty poor hygiene and being quite unappealing as a result. i now realise just how much this person had thoroughly poisoned my floor, and convinced me i was not worth anyones time or effort. begging for her affections is the most regrettable thing i have ever done, because i now realise that this was the ultimate symbol of how she would conditioned me to submit to her disgusting behaviour. as she revealed details of getting drunk and sleeping with someone earlier in the week, despite never wanting to be physical with me at the end, confessed details of drinking alone recently, and went back amp forth on getting back together to play with my feelings, i think the veil broke in my mind and i finally started to see her for what she is. this person that i had put so much time and energy into, who i had thought i loved with all of my heart, just uses people and discards them. as i sat in the hospital and received an outpouring of support, i realised just how little she had ever done for me. id received the most heartwarming messages of love and support from women i had slept with once and kept very poor contact with. if all of these people id only spent time with for one night, just to get physical, could offer so much support then why could not someone id know for most of my adult life? she blamed so much of her toxic behavioural and personality traits on past relationships, and even puts her various supposed mental issues in her tumblr biography as some sort of attention seeking excuse. this person is just a complete fraud and i now realise what an absolute manipulator she was. there is such a huge reason for her lack of success in making genuine friendships, and the gross people she is now seeing are just even more evidence of the fact that she will take anything she can get as long as she can use them for something. she has no dignity or respect in my eyes and i truly regret i let someone like this shape what could have been my last day on this earth. last night, a complete stranger came up to me and told me as a dad, he felt so much sadness and concern for my wellbeing that he had to say something. he gave me a hug and told me that he saw how much love i have to give and i should not even be here. after how much crying id already done that way, i could not believe how much hope i felt in my heart after hearing that from someone who did not even know me. i would need 4 hands to count the number of people who have offered to come over, who have spent time with me today, and just given me a phone call to let me talk and finally express the pain i have carried for so so long. some of my dearest friends have been so fucking supportive, and understood the pain and abuse i had endured for longer than anyone should have had to bear. i am sure things will not always be easy, and i know there will be times where my thoughts take over and i want to do something terrible. but after the ordeal of the last few days, i finally see the support that i have, and just how much i have going for me despite not realising it. i have made an interstate move happen all on my own, and been approved for my dream apartment. i am going out and meeting people, and tmi having really awesome sex after being with the most stale and unfulfilling sexual partner i have ever had. i go to the gym most days of the week now, and find so much enjoyment in working myself physically to improve my health. i put more time into my hobbies today, and found renewed vigour for guitar practice and my music theory work. i am practically drowning in job opportunities and have never felt so excited about the prospects in front of me. there are so many good things on the horizon for me, and one awful person should have never gotten in the way of that.all this is to say, i know that despite things not always going to be easy, i am glad i survived and that i am going to be ok. a lot of the work is on me and it will take a lot of effort, but i know what i need to do. if anyone has ever been in a position like mine, where someone has treated them this way and they feel there is no hope, just know that they are just one person who is trying to project their own shit onto someone else. for every one person like that in your life, you have 30 more who genuinely care and love you and want you to be ok. it was true for me, and i want this to be true to anyone who has gone through what i went through. attempted suicide on the weekend. now i feel so hopeful for the future.",Depression

21045,"i grew up in suburban tennessee, in a borderline fundamentalist christian community. my childhood was extremely comfortable, happy, and sheltered. i love my parents, they are genuinely caring, funny, enjoyable people. i never really acted out and i always did well in school. never once did i fear for my future or worry about what was going to happen to me in adulthood. when i was a senior in high school, i started to act out. i had a disrespectful, rude boyfriend. looking back, i fully understand why my parents did not like him, but he was my first boyfriend and teenage me was blinded by how much i loved him. while we were dating, a tried weed and we had sx, but like most normal teenagers i kept this from my parents. one day, my dad happened upon a fairly explicit text from him, and i was told to immediately stop dating him. i refused. this continued repeatedly throughout my senior year, with threats to not send me off to college and constant yellingcrying matched between them and i about why god disapproves of me and why it was hurting them so much that i was sxually active. i eventually lied to them and told them i broke up with my boyfriend. the summer between senior year and college, i saw him secretly all the time. i was constantly lying. it felt horrible, but i was so dumb and in love i did it anyway. i regret this time in my life a lot. i went off to college somewhere far away majored in music and even then my dad was reading my texts. he read one about me going to smoke weed with some friends, and immediately cut me off. i started to strongly believe i needed to be independent. i never asked for help from my parents. i got a job and worked almost everyday between classes my entire freshman year. i paid for everything but my tuition. although i was proud of myself for this at the time, it started a pattern that i could not reverse. it felt like i could not tell my parents anything for fear of losing them and losing the only real support system i had. i would not give them intimate details about my life anymore. i would not tell them when i was sad. i would not tell them when i would go to the doctor. i would not tell them when i got a diagnosis. i would not tell them if i was going to therapy. i only ever told them the positives. i would tell them if i would achieved something, or just had a normal, happy day. this worked for me for a long time. during college, i worked enough that i never had to ask for anything. i had my moments of sadness or worry, but i was happy knowing my life was stable. i broke up with my deadbeat boyfriend eventually, which was for the best, and suddenly my parents were proud of me again. the summer between my sophomore and junior years age 20, i stayed with my parents and interned at a music company. i had a rough summer because i started randomly hooking up with guys which was not my thing and i had to get my appendix removed which brought on several complications. my parents knew i was up to something all the time and started treating me coldly again. the withdrew their normal, funny, friendly selves and barely interacted with me. by this time i was tired of arguing with them, so i just did not confront them about it. but even so, they enforced an 11 o clock curfew on me, and still occasionally bemoaned that i was not a christian. this perpetuated the belief i already held, which was that my parents' hospitality towards me was conditional. it relied on me conforming to their idea of me. when i went back to school in the fall, the distance made things better. i started dating my current boyfriend, who i obviously could sleep with and hang out with and do anything with without my parents knowing, so they were in the dark, and perfectly happy about our relationship. my junior was incredibly happy. i had a boyfriend i loved, and my parents treated me like they were proud of me. senior year came along and i began to consider my life after graduation. my boyfriend and i planned to move in together with a few of our friends as well. we were going to move to la. this idea settled in the back of my mind during school, and then became the focus when i graduated. i came back to my parents' house this summer i am 22 and i graduated in may and the plan is to leave for los angeles at the end of july. i have been applying for jobs constantly. incessantly. i wanted so badly to get a job before i told my parents i was moving in with my boyfriend. i have worked day in and day out and i have not received a single email back. i understand this is how the music industry is, but my fear of moving out there and having no help from my parents at all because they do not believe in living with someone before you are married is enormous. my dad once told me that if i moved in with a boyfriend i better be able to completely support myself because i could not expect any help from him. i am exhausted by the amount of work i have done at this point, and completely emotionally drained by the fact that i have no acceptances or denials, just radio silence. i have become so obsessive and stressed about it that my entire brain is consumed. i cannot be distracted. i cannot even sleep well. i am a gigantic disappointment to myself, even though i know the industry i am trying to get into has very high barriers to entry. i have never in my life had no job, no school, and no purpose. my parents still treat me differently because i am not a christian. i do not go to church with them because of a particular incident where i ran out crying because the sermon was about homosexuality and sex before marriage. my mom barely talks to me on these days. i have stopped exercising and eating healthily completely. i am on my phone an ungodly amount. i cry everyday and spend the other parts either applying to jobs or laying in bed looking at meaningless crap on instagram. i have an extremely low tolerance for stress now. i can become debilitatingly anxious at the drop of a pin. i do not think i am the same person to my friends or my boyfriend. i am not as funny or lighthearted, i am really easily socially exhausted. i just want to be better. i want to be kind to people and be a great friend and a great girlfriend. i really desperately want a close relationship with my family, but i am so scared of losing them if i am too

52303,"i believe someone really has put a curse on me this year. i wish these past few months were all a joke. life really said, oh, lets make all these bad things happen to her and see her suffer, yay! bonus points because life made my hereditary anxiety pop out at full force to. it first started when my dog started to act not normal. her head would keep tilting every which way like she was drunk and eventually kept looking at the ceiling. it got so bad to the point where she couldnt walk or wouldnt eat anymore. it got worse during the weekend and we dont have an emergency vet near us so we had to call an on call vet from our clinic to come and look at her. he didnt really say much about her, just figured that it was neurological. my mom planned to bring her back to her regular vet on monday so they could further help her. she kept having seizures throughout the day as well and had labored breathing. my mom laid with her on the couch at night and watched the clock, waiting for 7 am to arrive. my dog didnt make it through the night. she died at 3 in the morning. i woke up that morning to my mom and dad telling me that she passed away. i got up out of my bed and quickly walked to the living room because i wanted to be with her. she died laying in her little bed that she loved. my family came and sat around her, crying and telling her that we love her. i didnt want it to be real. i wanted to say, mom, dad, shes just sleeping shell wake up and start barking any minute. but reality came back and thats when i knew, this is really happening. i went to school the next day. i didnt want to. i just wanted to stay in my bed all day and sleep. i was so tired. i couldnt even pay attention to what the professor was saying because i felt numb and detached from reality. after i got out of class i started feeling like i couldnt breathe. it hit me like a ton of bricks. my chest hurt bad too. i started to take my anxiety pills again after that. i never had anxiety this bad before. i realized its not like a cold that you can shake off. it sticks with you everywhere you go for a long time. i started off getting shortness of breath and chest pain. then it turned into feeling like my skin and heart were on fire and panic attacks that would jolt me awake at night and keep me up until 6 am. it did get better with time once i learned how to manage it. a few weeks later i was sending out reminders to my bridesmaids that dress shopping was coming up. i had reminded them months before because i wanted to make sure everyone could be there. i hadnt heard from one of my bridesmaids in about a month so i reached out to her to see if she was doing ok. she hadnt given me a response. the next day i asked if she was still coming, no response. on saturday, we arrived to the boutique to pick out bridesmaid dresses. she didnt text or call and didnt show either. she finally texted me the day after telling me she was backing out of being a bridesmaid. i was fine with that but wish she had communicated with me better. a few days after that i found a couple of black scuff marks on my car. theres a little crack by the marks to. turns out somebody side swiped my car and i didnt even see it until now. i figured i probably got hit in the college parking lot while i was in class so i called college security and had to meet up with an officer to give them specific time frames to look at in their security camera footage. im so sick of people hitting my car. i think my car has gotten hit about 5 times now. i got so anxious about telling my dad. i hope life gives me a break after this. i desperately need one.",Anxiety

34882,"squeezing feeling in my ribs hey guys. really glad i found this sub seems really helpful! was just wondering if anybody experiences a similar symptom to what i have a lot of the time. most of the time my body feels okay? okay enough, i guess. but once every 23 days i seem to get symptoms in and around my ribcage area. that entire section of my body suddenly feels very tense, and it gives me added symptoms too. when i stand up i get more lightheaded, my breathing because shallower by default, my heart races, and i sweat a ton. i also feel like there's a general squeezing action occuring around my ribcage. for example, when i take certain breaths i can physically feel the tension in my rib area. because this area is so close to my heart, i worry that it is actually my heart malfunctioning. i hope that isn't the case and it's more to do with my ribcage area being tense or something. the weird thing is that most of the time when this symptom comes along i'm not even nervous. it just always seems to happen in the evening when i'm watching the tv, or having just been for a walk. what makes it worse is that it doesn't leave either. the only way i can make it stop is by going to sleep and then my body 'resetting' to normal the next morning. sex can help the issue, but other times it makes it worse too. my body just feels full of adrenaline when the symptom start. so i was just wondering if anybody had anything similar? i just don't understand the source of it all. i'm rarely anxious mentally beforehand, but it seems as if my body is anxious. it just comes on so randomly. the problem is that from there on the symptoms it gives me are so uncomfortable that i worry about it. it makes me wonder if i have a heart problem or something along those lines. is it just all an internal anxiety attack built up from all of the tension my anxiety disorder in general gives me? is it some sort of adrenaline problem? i don't know but i desperately want to solve it because it hinders my functionality so much. i just turn into a breathless, tense mess when it hits me, and it causes me so much distress.",Anxiety

25345,"i am nearly 20, male, living in the uk. growing up i lived with my mum, my step dad, and my two half brothers. i was always an angry child, at 1011 my mum called the police on me because she kicked me out and i smashed a window.i went to live with my dad as i was starting secondary school, he never made me do anything and allowed me to play video games all day long. i stopped washing as often and therefore started to get bullied for having greasy hair by a lot of the people i thought were my friends in primary school. soon after i moved schools and over the next 5 years my confidence slowly increased and by the end of it i got along with nearly everybody. however during that time i spent pretty much all of my time, that i was not sleeping or in school, playing video games, to the point where i have now spent 10s of thousands of hours of my life gaming. my attendance and behavior at school gradually got worse and worse. i did not care about revising for any of my gcses and therefore failed most of them. after school i did not stay in contact with any of my friends. then i went to the local college, but once again did not care about the work and skipped a lot of days to play video games. after a few months i met my ex online and soon after dropped out of college. i remember the first time i met her, i saw her walking towards me and i remember thinking she was the most beautiful person i had ever seen. also i could see she was nervous and i felt more confident than i had ever felt in my life and every time we met then on i had the same level of confidence. however i would not meet her very often as she lived an hour away and her parents did not like me. also after dropping out of college i started to develop social anxiety as i never went out, never met any friends, stayed in my room all day playing video games and talking to her. after a year of dating her we started to argue a lot more, she would often lie to me about things that would happen because she was scared of my reaction, and then eventually when i found out i would have a go at her and end up blocking her. she was very insecure and could not understand why i took out all my anger on her and just wanted to spend my entire day playing video games, and on top of that i accidentally got her pregnant twice and she lost them both because of stress. towards the end the arguments seemed to happen every week and i did not realise it at the time but now i know her life must have been hell. she struggled at college, her parents were very strict, she had to sneak out and get a train to visit me, as i was too insecure to visit her, and on top of all that the person she loved would treat her like shit and prioritise gaming over spending time with her. after two years of dating her, and an argument about me getting an aquarium with my benefits money i decided to leave her. my biggest regret. i started to quit playing video games and after about a month i contacted her again and found out she had found someone new. it almost killed me, i started to drink alcohol, cut myself and spent a lot of my nights sitting on a bridge over the motorway. for two months i tried winning her back, but she lied to me and was actually dating this other guy the whole time. over the 6 months after i left her i spent everyday drinking and was arrested 3 times and nearly sectioned 3 other times for trying to kill myself and calling the police saying i had weapons to try and have them kill me, and everytime i was handcuffed i would try smashing my head on the ground or wall because i wanted to punish myself.it is over a year later, i have been taking mirtazapine for the last 8 months. i think about her every single day and have tried contacting her so many times with fake accounts but every time i get angry that she hurt me and just end up trying to hurt her more. and if all that is not bad enough, every time i have tried to hurt her i have used every secret thing she told me she was insecure about because i wanted to hurt her as much as possible. i know this is pure evil. i now live in a caravan outside my mums house, i do not play video games anymore, i have been going to the gym everyday for the last few months, i have started to read books. i have got a few tattoos. i have tried to move forward with life and actually become a man. but since taking mirtazapine my memory has got a lot worse and i struggle to think straight. which is good for not obsessing over my ex but how can i have a future and live if i cannot even think. and a lot of the time i do not see the point in even trying, the best case scenario is i become a man and independent but even then i know i will end up hurting more people and i just do not want to hurt anybody ever again. i just do not know what to do and my reoccurring thought is that if i kill myself than i will spare a lot of people pain in the future, and i guess to also stop myself from being hurt again. no friends, no job, no relationship. i am not a good person, i have hurt people my entire life. is suicide righteous if it prevents more harm from being inflicted.",Suicidal

13020,"honestly, this is my first reddit post. i have never felt this way before. the story starts way back about a year ago. i have felt some sorts of depression throughout my early teens and have experimented with extremely high retarded in fact doses of otc medication to see the effects and what would happen with the goal of not waking up over some stupid shit i honestly should not have been stressed about. some dumb ass shit like getting yelled at or getting in trouble. i have been diagnosed with adhd since elementary school and have been pumped up with adderall and melatonin everyday in order to just act remotely normal and behave. around the beginning of high school i stopped everything completely and did act out a bit in school and with my parents, but nothing severe. i then started smoking weed, and a lot of it. i was high for probably 3 years of my life straight. every morning, and every night i would get absolutely blasted in order to just keep to myself and not because any trouble and a good nights rest. i vividly recall in grade 10 trying to stop smoking and i did not touch anything for a full week and i felt out of it and fried for the whole week so i just kept it going. i started to sell to keep up with my habits, and that is when my parents caught on. i would lash out and just be a brat towards my whole family. in grade 12 i failed my first 2 classes of the year and was not on track to graduate. my parents kicked me out, and i left the country to stay with close family. i was doing all my classes online and had great success. i decided to go towards the route of engineering specifically software and got straight a's in all of the prerequisites needed for university. i took a full year 8 classes of online high school and finished them all in a semester. i enrolled in university conditionally for the program and am just finishing up my last finals in order to upgrade my university classes i also graduated high school early and got my transcript. the problem is when i came my family would just shit on me and say it was all my fault i got in this position, and that if i did not change i would kill my parents. i would finish my work and in turn i would get liquor on the weekends to celebrate a job well done. at this point i was studying 14 hours a day, 7 days a week with no days off. at this point for a long time i was drinking on my own to cope with myself and help me sleep keep in mind i have been out of the country away from my families house since the beginning of the school year. my family i am staying with took my phone and went through my group chats and found old snaps of me smoking with my friends and what not, and took my phone away. i have not talked to my parents, or my friends in around 8 or 9 months, with the exception of my parents calling my family and in those situations they would mute the phone and force me to smile, say everything was alright, and give the phone back to them so my parents would not suspect anything. around 2 months ago when i graduated i started hanging out with my cousins and partying, and that is when my family found out i did cocaine, smoked lots with them, and drank regularly. currently i am not addicted or dependent on anything, but i am at the lowest point of my life. i life my whole life wrapped around the finger of my family. i can not watch tv, listen to music, work out, hang out with my family, or even take elongated breaks to eat or take a shower. my family is planning to have a road trip back to my home country to drop me off to my parents, but i truly do not see myself seeing my parents, friends, or family ever again. i genuinely do not see myself going to university, or even going home. currently i just wake up at 430, and study until 830 with 15 minute breaks to eat and take a shower before i sleep. i used to love talking to people and eating and hanging out, now i only feel remotely content by myself. i feel no urge to eat, i feel no contentness with my life, and i am overwhelmed with guilt for all the pain and suffering i have caused my family back home. i have zero appetite and like fucking clock work i puke my guts out every morning at 730. my family forces me to eat and i can not hold anything down. i am rapidly losing weight, and am losing the urge to live. i know i am for sure missing a lot out and it may be mixed up, this last year has been the craziest year of my life, but i think i got all the main bits in. i was just wondering if anyone felt this way, and if anybody thinks i am crazy, or being driven to that point. my family assures me its all my fault, and my lack of appetite is me screaming for attention and i am a attention seeking bitch, but i truly feel no urge to eat, and every day they just yell at me worse and worse and it pushes me closer and closer to the edge of killing myself. i truly am at rock bottom, and ready to end it all. i live my life in darkness, with nothing to look forward to,

11890,"two days ago, i had my first mental breakdown at work because i was blamed for everything for a mistake which in my opinion was not my fault, crying for 15 minutes at home, homeofficelet me summarize what happened. i am a sales not manager guy, and i am in charge of pricing and getting orders from my customers and especially maintaining the situation for newrampd projects and its sample phases. i have one senior manager colleague from purchasing who is in charge of purchase and she is responsible for preparing stock. so we have to unfortunately keep in touch and work together as she needs to know the project situation from my customers and prepare stock accordingly.so, in beginning of this year, my customer gave me information of the material list and that sop is scheduled for november 2021. the lead times for us to prepare is long 40 weeks, thus my colleague keeps asking me if she should issue orders to our suppliers. as i did not want to go for any risks, i warned my customer about the lead times and said they should release firm orders to us, so i have a commitment and know they will buy the stuff we prepare. my customer kept saying the list is still not finalized but the list would go to the forecast soon and release order soon and they are aware of the lead times. i explained to my colleague to only order if we have something firm and she agrees, and says she would wait until the list of items are in our customer's purchase listforecast in their system.still, in mid of 2021 we still have not received any firm orders and i kept pushing my customer every week. the only reply was, that orders will come soon. then, last week i received feedback from my customer that the list got smaller and only 4 of the 10 original items are needed still no order from customer. at the moment my colleague told our director that we actually already issued order to our supplier to my surprise for the 10 items and i am at fault for now having dead stock because i am bad at managing this. furthermore, she kept asking and harassing me why the customer did not release any orders despite sop is november. i told her i explained to the customer many times and they said they understand the situation and will wait with the lead time. furthermore, it is not our fault if the customer does not release orders when we explained them many times the conditions. well, she did not care or give a fuck.so after that my colleague harassed me for being bad at this job and managing poorly and being fault for having dead stock now she is responsible for purchases to our suppliers, she of course snitched and complained at out managing director and blamed everything on me. because i am quite the small fry compared to her in the company hierarchy, the director at first believed only her story and continued criticizing me. every try of me to explain that i told her to only order when there is commitment from customer, and that we did not know the list of materials was still pending until last week, was seen as a poor excuse. my director looked for reasons to blame me, such as it was also my responsibility to oversee what is ordered and to tell the customer they need to buy our stuff if we already prepare that for them. when i tried to say we should not have ordered at the first place which is her responsibility, i was just shut down.after that i just hoped to die with my 30 years instantly. i was just frustrated of everything and wanted to cease to exist and cried in the corner for 15 minutes. i think this is what we call power harassment in the office and i guess i was the victim. never felt so miserable but i think this is unfortunately quite common in work life. i am at this company now for 4 years and i realized the senior purchasing colleague is a bigshot because she is good at maintaining her juniors low and never letting anyone overtake her. she keeps all the difficult work for herself so that no one can replace her. so unfortunately, even if she has problems with some colleagues, she is not easily replaceable.today my superior helped me and we had a 2 hour meeting with my director explaining what i did for this project since 2020 and made clear that i never supported the idea to order stuff without commitment from customer. thank god, after that my director believed me and said he will check why our purchasing team ordered the stuff.but still, i still feel miserable for being blamed and that senior colleague from purchasing of mine will for sure continue to do so next time and blame everyone for little mistakes as long as she benefits from that.i used to be such a motivated man when i started working, now i just realize how fuckup this worklife can be. first mental breakdown at work and cried for 15 minutes",Depression

23139,"i got heavily exposed to some really toxic mold about five years ago while working as a scuba instructor. there was a thin layer of it on the interior of my scuba regulator and i was breathing off of that regulator for about 4 hours a day for 2 months underwater and as a result of that my mental health totally collapsed in about 7 weeks flat once i had figured out what was going on it was too late i had been severely poisoned i have been trying to get my mental health back ever since a couple of years ago i developed sudden onset severe debilitating tinnitus, with my hearing test coming back as normal. every time i talk to a doctor about this one of two things happens and they either say that is impossible and kill the issue or they do not know how to help or who to refer me to and kill the issue i have done a lot of my own research and have had some success controlling symptoms with various supplements but i need back up on this and there just is none. i have tried bringing what i have done and the limited success that i have had to my health care providers attention on multiple occasions and they have nothing worthwhile to say its always they do not know what to do and do not know who to refer me to and then the issue dies once again the research and the understanding just is not there yet for this kind of issue to date my health insurer refuses to acknowledge or entertain this issue. and insists all symptoms are mental health related only but also refuse to provide adequate testing to prove otherwise yes or no.i was recently able to push for a head mri and it showed something interesting in that it showedflagged for chronic paranasal sinus disease. this was interesting since previously my health insurer refused to authorize any test that would show such a condition and obviously what the mri technician saw on the mri was bad enough that it warranted calling the inflammation chronic with no other scan to compare it to. i do not have a clogged or stuffed nose. it is looking like i may have haddo have a phantom cyclical fungal infection in my sinuses for half a decade now that is causing my tinnitus and mental health problems. i asked my health insurer for a ct scan to see the extent of the problem and a biopsy culture to see what is causing the problem, both were immediately denied. i am currently fighting them on that. what is the point on giving someone an mri if you plan on just ignoring the results. if a ct scan and a biopsy culture shows a chronic fungal infection that is causing the inflammation, my tinnitus and my mental health problems might be treatable with the right combination of antifungals and steroids to treat the infection and bring down the inflammation. they are refusing to provide treatment by not providing the testing to see what treatment would help.i have been currently experience long term passive suicidal and or mutilation impulse on a near daily bases as a result of my current situation for seemingly no other reason. my health insurer is well aware of this and are celebrating since they finally provided a single individual therapy session and they feel that a single therapy session a month is adequate treatment for the situation that i am currently facing. i have been so destroyed by this situation that i am unemployed living with family and as result of making so little income last year i just switched over to state medical insurance. since i am now on state insurance my copays are zero and i am pretty sure that i can weaponize the current laws against my health insurer.these days i am passively suicidal on basically a daily basis but not actively suicidal. the current rules state that i am supposed to go to emergency if i am passively suicidal. i do not because i think that it is a waste of my time since there is no treatment there but i think that i might start going. since, if i start showing up to my health insurers emergency with passive suicidal thought on a regular basis they are required by law to check me in and evaluate me every time but cannot hold me unless i pose an immediate threat to myself or others. this will bill the state a few thousand dollars each time this happens and will only be a time inconvenience to me at what point will the state stand up and take notice? fifty thousand dollars of the tax payers money wasted, a hundred thousand, five hundred thousand? there has to be a threshold here where they start asking what the hell is going on here. i doubt they will blame the suicidal guy that is just trying not to die by suicide. then i can leak the story to the media and let the story snowball from there. the negative publicity for health insurer may be very significant. let me know what you think? i am thinking about weaponizing the current laws against my health insurer to get adequate testing and treatment let me know what you think?",Suicidal

11636,"and has life gotten better?ampx200bno. everything is worse.i had some depressive bouts leading up to 21 over how much i was missing out on things that would make me happy. i had never had a date, let alone a relationship, never drank or went to parties and had wild fun like the other people my age i was too meek and scared of everything and despite constant jobhunting, my age and inexperience only ever got me a part time job cleaning public toilets, which did not help as i already felt gross. i disliked myself quite a lot, as i was overweight, short, unhygienic, unattractive, and i acted goofy, childish, loud and overly sensitive. but i can say that i was a hopeful optimist. i still kind of liked myself i believed i was a good person with a good mind, worthy of love and acknowledgement, and had dreams of working in my creative talents with my thenfriends, falling in love, and generally never wanted much like a ton of money or any unique opportunities, just the average house and family life that everyone tends to get, which has always been my focus. and it seems easy enough for everyone else to get, right?i tried. i mean, i really did try, for a decade. i jobsearched like crazy for years while bouncing around my familys homes, doing unpaid work experience after unpaid work experience just to have enough skills to actually be employable, for something other than needing a friend of a parent to put a good word in for me to even qualify as a toilet cleaner. when my dad said he was moving away to live with his new family he invited me to come, but i was 25 and already felt like a leeching loser, so lived off beans and boiled potatoes just to afford a spare room in a house share enough to be out of his way. i got into being more healthy and lost 55lbs during that time, cleaned up my hygiene and nutrition. it stuck, and i now go months without eating any sugar, learnt to cook well, and exercise every day. i went back to university to meet new people, as all my friends had drifted off in life or abandoned me altogether, and i also still had not had a relationship, so thought it would be a great way to meet likeminded people adult connections that stick around and are mutual, as opposed to the ones id made in childhood that had drifted off around 21. it was draining, but i did manage to graduate. trying to study, work, look after myself and meet people was hard to do all at once because i never really was good at growing up id had a 4 year agoraphobic stint in my teens that had given me anxiety and really damaged my ability to socialise or develop like a normal person, i have been unable to relax in normal situations or properly approach mandatory experiences of growing up like other people do. i was trying really hard to push through it though. i really did try.and what did i get for trying?i managed to upgrade my parttime minimum wage toilet cleaning job to a parttime minimum wage retail job, and have been stuck there for 5 years. i cannot advance in it because my completely broken social skills and introversion makes me really awful at customer service. and because my degree was creative where employability is based off contacts, privilege and experience, i am still no more employable or liable for better work than i was before university, i just have more debt to pay back. i went to study film, which has always been something i have loved probably the only thing in life i have ever felt in love with. after college, which ended when i was 20, i felt a bit like the magic had gone, because i saw behind the curtain which took a bit of the magic away, but was still interested in a career in it. now after university, at 29, i despise it. i have no interest in working in film. 90 of my hobbies were creative based, and i do not even have any creative ideas anymore. i carried this internal sense of imagination and a case of maladaptive daydreaming with me for so long in my life that it was a huge part of me, but now all creativity is drained and i do not know who to be without it. my head is so out of it, i can barely register and react to things that happen in the real world anymore, let alone create complex things in my head. sometimes i react late to conversations i am in the middle of. my cognitive function has crashed and i do not even think i could handle a harder job than retail now. but film was a secondary reason to study, i went to uni to open up socially and actually feel like part of the human race again. and did i? no. i did not have a single date, a single relationship, i did not make a single close friendship or helpful connection, because i am awful and broken and not likeable, interesting or attractive enough for people to want to put effort in for or stick around with anyway. my social skills are actually worse, because my mental health problems and selfimage are worse. the idea of love and relationships have always been a huge trigger for my anxiety, probably because i wanted it so much having a family was basically my biggest life dream, but my selfesteem is so nonexistent that my philosophy now is, if i like someone, they are already too good for me. and now its pretty much impossible because i have come to find people so insanely confusing and unrelatable and i have not found anyone that comes close to otherwise in over a decade. at least at 21, i kind of understood the generation i was around, but the world seems so scary and aggravating and confusing now, i do not know how i am supposed to relate to any of the younger people i am around who want to follow each others social media accounts or talk in memes, when i am older and just want to have real conversations. how the fuck do university students manage to get into so many relationships when they just seem to talk about weird shit they saw online and the sesh? i do not understand people anymore, and my odds of finding a new best friend or a relationship have plummeted to nonexistent as a result. i have not been really timid and untrying throughout this time either. i genuinely got involved, put myself out there, engaged in conversations despite being a massive introvert, even arranged some days out, started drinking and went to a few parties, and tried my best to be human. but apparently people did not find the attempt good enough. noone has ever shown an interest in wanting a connection with me. th biggest change in life i got out of university was getting wasted for the first time, but that has now evolved into me just wanting to drink all the time, despite the fact that drinking only every makes me cry anymore, i still just want to do it every night. i do not because i had an alcoholic mum growing up, and i also still try to tell myself i want to focus on being healthy and nutritional. and especially mental healthwise, people say that stuff helps. but does it? no. that is bullshit. i do not eat anything that is not nutritionally beneficial, i get so many vitamins a day and only eat fresh meat and veg. and yet, i am still tired and sad all the time, and most of my joints and bones constantly crack and hurt. and do i feel better about myself after all the effort and worry i put into reading every food packet, forcing myself out of bed to work out, forcing down disgusting, flavourless meals because i am paranoid about the extra calories sauces and flavouring would add? no. i have developed a massive case of body dysmorphia, i find myself grotesque and i despise myself more than ever. i used to just dislike myself physically and behaviourly but now i do not even think i am human. i used to know i was overweight, but still likeable enough to not die alone. but damn, now i envy the people that get to cut me a wide berth. i am stuck with having to be around myself. if i were any of the people i am attracted to, i would not want me kissing me or making eye contact during conversation with me either.if getting 50,000 into student debt still cannot get me a relationship or friendship, if focusing and stressing so hard about what i eat and how i live still makes me even more utterly hateful of myself, if creativity was my passion and now my head is so disoriented and depressed that my ability to be creative has completely died for good, then i think i have tried enough. i cannot keep trying and failing. i am pretty sure i am done.i am not an 18 yearold who still has their best years ahead of them. i am 30. i have statistical, experiencebased evidence that it does not get any better. i refuse to try for another 30 years and potentially get my first date or my first proper job at the age of 50. at that point, its just not worth it to me, and i know there are going to be some people who say it is who say life begins at 40 but it is not. for most people, life begins at 16 from there, they make close friends, learn to drive, have wild sexual encounters and spontaneous travel adventures, find a home they feel comfortable in and have the strength and energy to make money to maintain it, and most importantly, they find love with someone who thinks they are worth something. i have done none of those things. but i promise you, i have tried.i am a logical person. i am a third of the way through my life, and its been a failure so far. even if i tried for another third and succeeded, and then got to enjoy the fruits of that success with the last third, that is only a third of my lifespan worth living, and that is not enough of a percentage to make the extended struggle worth it to me. its easier to just call it a failed attempt and go. i am honestly kind of glad that 30 is coming up and i made that promise to myself. it gives me a pointed reason to show this is not some spontaneous emotional reaction, but a legitimate planned attempt to try and improve things that has not worked out. i honestly have thought about offing myself early, but i guess my dad would like a photo of me at my delayed graduation because of the restrictions, as he has a photo on his wall of all his kids and stepkids, but none of me, as i have not succeeded in anything. so i guess ill wait for his benefit? before anyone says, i am not close to my dad, or any of my immediate family. hanging around for their sake is not a legitimate reason. blood is just a viscous liquid that transports oxygen, vitamins and nutrients around the body, it does not create convenient responsibilities to other peoples lives because that blood shares a similar coded structure. at this point, id be glad to go. i have had suicidal points in the past but they were always emotional and i always bear through them alone, having noone i am close to or i feel really cares for or gets me. i always would not want to feel that way, get scared about it, not want to die because i wished my life would be different, and have a breakdown or deafen myself with distractions or something. but now i am genuinely, legitimately out of hope to the point where i am completely numb to it and i am not even upset anymore. life is what it is. i have no emotion. what would i be sad about? the loving relationship id miss out on? its obviously not happening. and what a tragedy it would be to miss scraping by on living in a shithole month to month on an unliveable salary, eh? i guess i am only posting this because i am no longer myself at all instead of being that bubbly and childish yet worrisome and cautious overlyemotional 21 yearold baby, i am now an untalkative, slow, illtempered borderline alcoholic who feels nothing. id always felt it seemed selfish to pity myself when other people have it worse and i always cared way too much about what people think, but i do not care anymore, and i feel i have earned the right to be selfish and i deserve to have people know that if everyone other normal person can get recognised, respected, valued, wanted or loved to some degree, then i at least tried.i do not expect things to change over the next 6 months, instead of trying anymore i will just spend the time daydreaming about the better life inside my head and getting affairs in order. i am interested to see and hope that i have the bravery to go through with it in 6 months, but this really does feel like a turning moment where i have accepted it. i feel all that fear from when i was 21 has gone and i have the personal skills and the hopelessness to get out of this failed excuse of a lifetime.sorry this was so long. and hopefully this does not just automatically confirm the idea that things never improve for anyone. if you are young and are thinking that, things may work out differently for you it is a possibility. they just did not for me is all. when i was 21, i made a selfpact that if nothing in life was better by age 30, id kill myself. i turn 30 in exactly 6 months.",Depression

48692,"so much happened this week and i can't handle myself. i am 28 years old and my birthday is tomorrow. i am not the one who cares much about my age or celebrates it. however i am having a very bad week and seem too stressed out. to start with, i was on a weekend trip with my girl friends to relax and meet after 2 long years. it was fun. but i am always the 3rd wheel in that friendship. they both are nice to me and they wish well for me. but i am the complete opposite of them. they are funny , crack jokes , extrovert and i am none of it. i just listen to them and enjoys the company sort of. they are good looking and can carry themselves. i am bit on the fatty side and does not look much good in the pictures. i think it always bothers me. anyways , i come back from the trip and thought to stay with my boyfriend for some days. i feel lonely even when he is around. he gets very excited about his work and talks continuously about it. i am very much discouraged and demotivated by it even though i should not. he helped with a lot of stuff at work. i keep wondering why i am not excited as much as he is. i am interested in doing my work but i am not an expert. just an average person at work. but i am a team lead too and the management part of comes easily for me. i normally handles the new joinee mentorship, any documentations, managing the team calls , setting up sessions. somewhat what a culture team would do. i like doing this but i don't want to be known for it. anyways past week, my department head called me up and said he sending some names selected for attending a training and asked to review it. i thought i might be in it but i was not. every lead except me which made me very sad. i do not know why i was not even considered. i am not that bad. yet again. this all happened when i was still at my boyfriend's place. i don't think he knows i was struggling with all this negative vibes happening. still i thought i will hold my head high. i started going through my drive which the girls uploaded the pics of us. i don't normally go through it. i thought i might as well because my sister was asking for pics. so i selected some which i looked better with them. i thought i will send some good ones and some bad ones for the fun of it. the moment i send it, she replied telling me i look terrible in it. that i have put on too much weight and no one would tell this to my face. by that point, i was breaking down. i was crying hard and was feeling so much heavy in my heart. i was with my boyfriend and yet he does not know my heart was breaking with all the pain. i don't if i should blame him or i should have gone to him. may be he does not know i am struggling and i am not willing to tell him my struggles. so i texted my sister back, yup, i know. i don't think she know i was upset. then my second sister texted me saying i should take care of my health. our family has diabetes genes. she was telling me the same thing. i was okay with her msging but i am very upset with the other sister for bitching about my weight. i only send pics to her. this all happened on friday. at work, i did literally nothing. i could not do anything. i keep thinking about hypothetical scenarios and to wishful thinking if i could just leave everything behind. it was so much pain. tomorrow is my birthday and i want to be alone.just alone. i don't know what to do. i don't know if this birthday is the thing that's making me miserable. but honestly i am not worried about getting aged. i am just tired. i know i should not expect people to come to you. but oh man i wish i could have someone who can feel me and i can open up to. i know i have people to talk. people will listen to me. but i can't open up to them. everything is bottled up inside and i am so so stressed and sad and what not. i just wanted to write my miseries. hope this helps me.",Stress

47668,"partner with chronic depression started ghosting me, seeking advice i've been seeing this person for about 5 months and until recently everything seemed to be going really well between us. we texted most days and hung out around 2 times a week on average which felt like a lot considering their time off and energy levels. about a month and a half ago they told me they were having a depressive episode. i've never had a partner with chronic depression and was pretty ignorant to what it can do so i was taken by surprise when they started ghosting me about a week ago. it was very abrupt and everything seemed to be going really well until then. since then i've tried my best to learn up and it and it seems like this kind of thing is pretty common among people with chronic depression, especially those who've had a long history of partners who do not react well to their depression. normally, i would not tolerate someone ghosting me, but reflecting back on everything they've told me about their depression and how they're dealing with it made me realize how much effort they put into trying to address their depression and maintain a relationship in spite of it. they've confided in me a lot of trauma they've had to deal with in their life and the type of thoughts they struggle with. last time we hung out in person i could tell they'd been really struggling with some of those traumatic events recently. even during this episode they had some pretty traumatic events happen back to back but still made an effort to hangout and talk to me with everything extra they were now having to deal with. i would like to make an effort to keep contact with them for a reasonable amount of time and hopefully get back to how we were before the depression got this bad. the ghosting still hurts, and it's totally possible that they are just being a bad person and not telling me they don't want to see me anymore, but after researching it and talking about it in therapy and with some of my friends who deal with depression i think it's more likely they're pulling away due to the depression. over the past week i sent two messages trying to be supportive and let them know that i respect their space and want to interact with them in any small way they want. however, i've learned that these longer texts more than a couple sentences can be harder for a person going through a depressive episode to respond to and might make them feel worse for not responding. definitely don't thing the messages were bad or anything and the people i shared them with agreed, but it looks like going forward i should keep messages shorter and easier to respond to with an emoji or maybe even a small response. given all this, i'd just like some advice from those also struggling with chronic depression about how you'd like a partner who you've been seeing for as long as i've been seeing mine to communicate with you during situations like this. my current plan is to keep going with my life, but text them again a week from now and maybe continue doing that for 23 months or until they tell me to stop. i don't want them to feel overloaded with my messages and push them away but i do want to keep the idea in their head that i'm still here and want to be with them. thank you all in advance!",Depression

12049,"i have not ever told anyone everything and i am not exactly sure what this is even for, whether i just want know someone to cares, or maybe i just want someone to know and remember me.it is been a dark couple of days and i keep thinking that i am just so tired of being alive and in pain. i do not think i ever really want to die, but i definitely do not want to keep on living if life is this.i guess i should start by saying that i am privileged, i have access to free healthcare with no limitations on mental health, i have a therapist that i click with and is wonderful, i have a job that i care about and a mother that loves me. and still i cannot find any desire to carry on.i was a medic in the army, and i was and still really am not ready to deal with the reality of it. i made mistakes and i cannot shake off the what ifs, should haves and could haves. i always remember that i made mistakes, i called things good enough, i did not speak up for the casualty when i could and should have, and it led to the picture in my mind that i always come back to, telling our air force jtac officer that i was sorry and there was nothing left i could do. worst of all, it was just the congruence of so many small things that added together to create the situation, so that the situation crept up on me and i was not aware where everything was heading until it was too late. it is really the guilt and fear that gets to me.i am afraid of myself, my actions and my mistakes, especially the potential of causing unforeseeable, unpreventable catastrophic harm. i do not trust myself to do the right thing, or to do the good thing, so i try to put myself in a place where i will never have to do anything. i am so scared that i will harm or allow harm to come to people around me, so i have withdrawn, and slowly tried to fade out of everyone is lives. this way i cannot hurt them now and it will not hurt them as much when i finally do go through with it. but this also scares me, because the idea that no one outside of my family and maybe 2 friends would really care if i killed myself is terrifying.i am cognizant enough to know that killing myself is a selfish thing, something that will because harm, instead of good for the people around me. i know it will be unfair to my family, my friends, my therapist, my coworkers, but that voice that says i am a fundamentally bad, unlovable, broken burden can feel so definitive. i have told myself that since i am an organ donor, it would be better because i will be doing something positive to offset partially the negative, but i do not know if i fully buy into it yet.it is been over 9 years now that i have felt like this, i have run through the rest of my 20s and it has maybe only gotten worse, or at least it definitely has not gotten better. i am now 32 and i am so fucking lonely. in that time, i have tried to kill myself, gone through a 4 month ptsd recovery program, had a loving relationship destroyed by my idiocy and baggage and then tried to kill myself again. i just got out of the inpatient wing of a va hospital a couple weeks ago, after i checked myself in from fear of what i would do to myself and now, 2 weeks later, i am on the edge again. i do not want to die, i find that i am still scared of doing the deed when it gets close, the harm and pain it would because some people, but i do not want to live anymore without the prospect of getting better and i am so, so tired of being alive, in pain and unable to connect with other people. i do not see a future where things get better, and i do not see a future where i can keep going indefinitely which is fucked because i know how good i have it compared to so many people. i have unlimited medical benefits, and the veterans administration has been good to me. i believe in my work, and i have a great job here at the va medical center, helping other veterans. the idea that i do something meaningful or bring positive things in other people's lives keeps me going, but then the darkest ruminations come in, where i can see how i harm people, because pain and burden in a shitty, destructive way. when that belief in myself is gone, then the resentment comes, the anger and frustration of how my suicide would hurt loved ones, holding me back. it is the frustration at the idea of being trapped, feeling forced to live for them instead of doing what i really want.if you have made it this far, thank you and i am sorry for even posting this, for creating something that will invariably because and spread pain to other people. i know i should not just share the pain, because misery loves company, but i am also just so scared and lonely and afraid that i will die without anyone ever knowing or understanding. i guess i just want this off my chest",Suicidal

11831,"sorry this is long but i doubt anyone will even read this but i just need to get this off my chest. i have always struggled with depression since i was a young child. on and off numerous medications throughout the years, nothing worked because, at the end of the day, i did not have things in life that brought me joy as others did. i was an awkward introvert with anxiety and depression. i fought through depression for years and really busted my but to get a good job and work up and create goals for myself to really not let depression get me. i have a great job. i am so grateful for what i have and yet. life. just. feels. pointless. i feel like i am drifting with no direction and i cannot seem to pull myself out of this pit. everything this i do just does not make this feeling go away. therapy and acknowledging why i have attachment issues and things from my past doest change the feelings. i understand my past, i understand my issues, but knowing this or talking about it does not change my obsessive thoughts and deep depression. medications never stopped my thoughts, sleeping pills barely helped my sleep. on top of my already struggling chemical depression, i feel my life has just gone down the drain of everything i worked for. ill skip the childhood and long list of life trauma and jump to the past year topresent. since i worked hard to overcome those.my fiance and i broke up because i walked away from a toxic situation to try to better my life. he was bipolar. anxiety medication made me gain 40lbs i was underweight before so this was not making me obese but it still did not feel good and cannot' seem to shake iti have lost 6 family members in the past 3 years including my sister. my fiance told me not to bother him with my grieving because it was annoying. so i learned to just deal on my own. when i was trying to move on from my ex, my male friend tried to rape me at a party. when i tried to talk to anyone about it everyone just told me to get over it so i did and kept on moving forward. i moved my job and gave up the home i owned to be with my ex, who changed his mind. learned to appreciate it and enjoyed the ride. i am living in a temporary apartment trying to decide where to live with no furniture bc why bother if i do not stay. lived trying to appreciate how nice it is in a new place. i had a pay cut at work due to the pandemic forcing me to live in a cheaper place far away and now have to travel 1.5 hours to the office each way. but that is okay, more time for audio books. i did not let any of those things get me down. i tried to just find happiness in everyday things and get through. i knew walking away from a bad relationship would be hard, but that it would lead me to a better life. things started to look up, i got a raise, i started working out daily, was really putting in the effort to say yes to things instead of no, spent a lot of time outdoors, read as many books as i could. joined a few dating sites to keep my options open to love. a year after my break up and moving out we had a long weekend at work for the 4th. i got depressed, no friends were around, i felt so lonely and pathetic. went running, to the pool, i got myself some nice craft beers and just started reading, watching funny movies and just tried to pull myself out of this. even treated myself to sushi to try to cheer me up and just enjoy my time with myself. but by the final day of a long weekend alone, after many many months alone. i just broke down and cried. ended up drinking a bit and just let it out. felt my depression. but then. random burst inside of my overwhelmed me and i said to myself.i will not give up. i am awesome and great and i know someone will see that. i am fun to be with, loveable, funny, i have a great career, finances growing, i got this, made a visionboard. so after 1 year of dating sites, i have talked to hundreds and hundreds of guys. i feel like i can tell pretty quickly when i click or do not, and really have not experienced any conversation of interest. i still knew id find someone but was picky for a conncetion. people told me it was because i was not open or wanted my ex, but i really was open, i just could not find the chemistry i was looking for in a partner. i really try to add to the convo and ask questions and elaborate to build connections, i am really good one on one building connections. but then. an incoming message from someone new. just another guy that took the time to write something out but the responses had so much personality to them. i started getting excited to see them come in. we moved to another chat app and starting messaging from sun up to sun down every day for a few days, then he asked me out. he was busy but wanted to make it for the following weekend. we continued to chat all day every day completely connecting on so many levels. he really confirmed he was interested in me and was so excited to meet me and was clear i was what he was looking for and everything we chatted about was deep and connected and understanding and always followed up that we were still interested. nothing really changed and then in the second week of chatting, pics, and videos. we were writing back and forth, he usually initiated and we both continued the convo. nothing happened or was said but it one second after i respond i was left with unread. never heard from him again and it is been about a week and he never even opened the message. i sent another one a few days ago just expressing i wish him the best and enjoyed chatting and such but thought we connected and were still interested. that was never opened as well. i had not been blocked thought, maybe that was something as my mind obsessively overthinks it. anyways, skip to a week later. i got too attached to someone i never met. i was walking on air excited to chat with someone i was so into. we talked too much it honestly felt implied we would clearly be dating after meeting and that was just a formality. i get it, i was stupid to care before the meeting. but i could not help it. i was still chatting with others to not put eggs in a basket but no one had my attention as he did. it felt easy and effortless. i took a break from online dating to recoup and ground myself. obsessive thoughts consumed me. what happened? what did i do? he was so reassuring and thoughtful. i could not sleep for a week. i could not control my thoughts of failure after a year of trying after my fiance and i broke up. i stared at my computer all week watching emails and emails come in with no desire to respond. depression has taken over. i decided to take to reddit just to let my feelings out. i am finding work so pointless. making money for what? to be alone? i had a few friends, they were depressed too getting out of bad situations as well and trying to find love. all of a sudden last night. i hit the worst low continuing into today. my friends have all left, two found new fresh love and are on the moon with joy after barely anytime being single inspired by how happy they saw me talking to that guy and they took to themselves and found people quickly and enjoying their start and really do not want to deal with depressed me. i was the one being so optimistic to them, telling them they got this and really trying to radiate positive energy. i am happy for them i wanted to see this as the universe showing love around me as if it was close for me too.but the universe slammed me with the same day, another death. another male friend cut me out because i told him that i did not see a romantic future with him and he kept trying to manipulate me to want the same things. it got ugly. my ex reached out saying he wished he could have loved me but just does not and does not know why he cannot care about me but wished he could. i got so low, made a call to everyone on my phone list that i talk to, and no one was around. i went for run. talked to a shrink who told me just to meetup with someone and get out. that is always the advice no one was around. walked for 4 hours straight. called a psychic just to give me some hope, something. just ended up making me feel worse. i am now sitting on my computer writing on reddit drinking whiskey out of the bottle realizing that i am defeated. i think my depression has won. i tried to overcome all these situations, better myself. now i am realizing i feel more depressed a year out of my toxic relationship than i ever felt in it. wishing i had it back because this feels worse. i cannot get myself to work. i am distracted in my mind all day every day. i cannot make myself leave my bed. i feel left behind. like everyone is moving along and no matter how hard i try. i keep getting kicked. i stare at the ceiling for hours on end. everything i tried to do to stay positive came collapsing. donated some money to some charities. tried to volunteer but i get anxious in groups. bought some nice things incase i got a date, to make me feel good. did a juice cleanse to boost my health. increased my exercise. i was going to my apartment pool, gym, anything to get myself out and about. at this point now. i cannot even get myself to watch tv or a movie, cannot read a book, cannot work. every time i get a mere boost of energy to be positive i get more news that brings me down. staring at a phone checking for that message that never comes. the psychic told me to change my energy. i feel like everything i do has failed and i am in such a dark place right now. i see loneliness or the company of people i force myself to be around since i am an introvert and do not connect with just anyone. i cleaned, i decluttered, i did all these positive things. even feng shui and crystals around the place to create good energy. i thought i had the light at the end of the tunnel after that long weekend, but now, i am at such a low i really cannot get myself out of it. i do not even have those small moments of pulling it together to clean or shower like i did before. i will probably get in trouble at work but i wish i could care but just do not. happiness should not depend on other people, i know this. but what do you do when nothing brings you joy. i was happy alone for a while, i liked myself, i saw myself as a catch and worthy of love. but now, i just feel kicked and defeated as nothing will ever change and all the men i like do not want me. the men i do not see a connection with romantically try to hurt me. or manipulate me. if life is settling, what is the point. if all there is work and exercise. i just do not see the joy in life. i give up. i am really really sad right now. i feel my life is pointless. like is life really just holding on every day? there has to be more than just holding on. i was able to work through a lot of things but now i do not feel it. i do not feel like life gets better. i just feel defeated and at the lowest darkness i have ever felt. i overcame things for what? i feel so dark and low. thanks to whoever is reading this and letting me vent this, long annoying rambling. i have hit my lowest low in life as of today.i just give up",Depression

8266,"it would just be nice to share perspective or see how other people help support their loved ones when things get tough or said loved ones are having bad episodes. but i also understand that hearing about said perspective and experience with living with depressed persons might come off as triggering to anyone who is depressed, if i were depressed i would hate to see how my depression has affected others around me. it is an inevitable thing that happens, and it is a complicated issue. but something that i think is not talked about much in my experience.it is a hard pill to swallow but being a part of a depressed persons support group can be really traumatizing when things get bad, more so if you live with them. like i have had to talk them down from suicide, bring them out of their intrusive suicidal ideation induced by substance abuse, cleaned up their blood after self harming occured, having to see them in a psych ward, being afraid of triggering an episode, being afraid of walking in on a dead body in your own home. and that is not accounting for being there for another relative who was in the hospital after an attempt or having a best friend who is also medically depressed. it is all around me.tw vent aheadand no matter what, despite all of that. you are always supposed to push down whatever feelings of anger and frustration or sadness you might have in favor of taking caresupporting the person that needs the most help at the moment. and feelings of resentment happen but i personally do not want to feel that way, i feel that letting those negative emotions take over helps no one, much less the person you want to help. but it is so hard sometimes, and it is hard to talk about without sounding emotionally selfish to some capacity, because you have a whole medically depressed person right there! so you automatically feel guilty for even taking your feelings in consideration. like how dare you be negatively affected my someone else's depression, fuck you! their well being and mental health is important than yours at the moment! suck it up! and i know that sounds like an exaggeration, but it is the reality of things. like whatever i am feeling needs to take a back seat because i need to reserve my emotional energy for when another depressive episode from one of my relatives rolls around. and yes this person has a psyche, a therapist, and meds. if they did not have those things they would have definitely been gone by now, but it still seems like it is going to be a while until they are able to manage their depression. it is just really hard and i feel so alone in these types of feelings i am having, these feelings that i feel like i cannot afford to have. but that is not realistic and these feelings are there and they are eating away at me, it makes me want to run away from it all. but again it can always be written off by a statement like this well whatever you are feeling i can guarantee you the depressed person is having a worse time than you right now and.they would be right.and i go back to feeling like shit and the cycle continues. but i feel so written off constantly because i am in such constant and close proximity to depression, i feel like i am not allowed to be cared about or acknowledge whatever it is i am going through or feeling. i just do not know if anyone feels this way. vent overthat said, i think a therapist would be the best answer to my plight but i do not have access to one, no healthcare, i am the process of having that be sorted out. and i know you can only do so much as a support, you are not supposed to shoulder to much of a depressed persons burden, but it is different when you live with them, you see the depression and you experience their episodes from the outside, except you are not exactly a bystander either and you got to get your hands dirty. so that is why i wanted to know if there is any collective of people who has experienced any situation similar. i do not know where else to ask this, but is there a support group for relatives living with depressed persons? or a support group for the support group of a depressed individual? it is a unique experience and i would like to speak with others who have experience living with medically depressed persons.",Depression

48048,"our control, our fear, our anxiety, our stress. why does it always have to lead to more of them? a plain and simple hi to begin most of this discussion will be off the top of my head and i'll be adding my own experiences. to start, there are situations in life that we genuinely have absolutely no control over. i myself suffer from mdd and struggle with it on a daily basis. i take medication, i try and get out more, i see a therapist and i'm trying to find a job that would interest me. i'm constantly worried about my future and whether i want to continue or not. one thing that happens quite frequently is that i create non existent situations in my head which cause even more stress and anxiety. once this cycle begins, it doesn't matter what it is, whether i have control over it or not, it's a nightmare to deal with this constant stress of anything that may happen. why does this occur? why are we as humans so unequipped to handle these challange? one could say the society we are surrounded by and what is expected of us causes a drastic change in the way we look, feel and think. to an extent this is true, but why is it so terribly exhausting and anxiety stricken to be able to even begin coping with what is going on around us. it's an obstacle i am incapable of clearing, i worry about anything and everything that involves me and those close to me. i'm consistently tired, in pain, anxious, worried and have had this heavy weight on my chest each and every minute of everyday for over 5 years. nothing seems to change, i keep telling myself tomorrow will be different, i'll do this and that and it will all be better. but when the time comes. i fall short, i let myself down, i let others down and most of all i continue the same cycle over and over again. is this a situation or cycle i've made up to comfort myself as all i know is this feeling of dread and doubt and fear and anxiety, or does it truly exist and hinder me? am i really my own worst enemy? why am i constantly at war with myself? it feels like a never ending battle, i fight back, but i don't fight hard enough. am i even capable of doing so? just what exactly is it that i'm waiting for. an idea, a person, an event or situation in my life? these consist of things i can and can't control. i feel as though i have no control over the majority of these things, which further pushes me to feel as though i have control over nothing. why do we have to suffer the way we do? why are our minds and body working against us? is it not the job of our brain to keep us alive and well? it's supposed to keep us alive for as long as possible, and we even have built in ways of surviving dangerous situations, but when it comes down to the core of it, our brains are what control us. our thoughts, our actions and feelings. yet its perfectly happy with the idea of us ending it.",Depression

35565,"unsubscribing today. thanks for all of your support. this sub has helped me through a lot of health concerns, but today i'm finally in a place where i can deal with it on my own so i'm posting to hopefully help someone else. i started off as a mess and eventually got a full heartbody checkup including an mri and wore a heart monitor for 24hours to check out my palpitations. after being told that everything is fine that was a big step. getting a professional, comprehensive medical diagnosis to rule out what you're worried about goes a long way. after chest pains, numbness, tingling in my limbs, dizzy spells, being sent to the er because urgent care thinks i might be having a stroke, and a ton of other shit, something outside my control changed my stress level. i took on a different role at work that is much less stressful. i had no idea how big of an impact this was because i didn't consider myself stressed but several symptoms subsided with this change like everything digestive and the chest pain is less frequent. after i was told the chest pains are costochondritis inflammation of the rib tissues, read stressinduced i saw a chiropractor for about 5 months who taught me some stretches and selfadjustments i could do with a back roller and now i've trained myself not to panic when i feel those chest pains. just do the stretches and trust that i'm fine and sure enough, i am. also, my doctor told me to cut caffeine and i didn't listen. i am a coffee junkie and cut back, but didn't cut it out entirely. well recently i switched to decaf i know, stick with me and it's been lifechanging. yes, this is obvious. yes, we all know caffeine raises your physiological arousal level. but many of us keep consuming caffeine not realizing just how much it actually contributes to the cycle. i'm a much happier person on decaf and i don't think i'll go back. i found out all of the shit i was dealing with can be caused by anxiety. so this whole time, it was the fear of a health problem that was causing health problems. stress impacts us more than we realize! so to recap, here are the things my dumb ass put off doing forever that really made a huge impact get a doctor's opinion. as in, a thorough one if possible instead of just a quick visit. they will run some tests and give you a professional take on it. when you get this trust it. if you have reason to believe the doctor missed something, get a second opinion but really you should trust the doctor. manage your external stress. this doesn't mean quit your job, but if something is stressing you out a situation at work, a significant other, family take some real steps to get out of that situation! in my case it was a lateral transfer and a change in responsibilities but man did it lower my stress levels. cut the caffeine and any other stimulants including recreational ones. if you struggle with anxiety, your brain is already pumping you full of stress hormones in a fightorflight response. you absolutely do not to make it worse. even a little can impact some people like me, apparently. for the love of reddit, never google your symptoms. the terrible thing about anxiety is once it has you, it's a downward spiral. but the inverse is true too. once you are confident in your situation and know the quirks of your own body, you can come out of it quickly too. hope this helps someone.",Anxiety

18323,"i am going to be turning 30 in a couple weeks.i am a white dude from washington state and i grew up playing a lot of video games n64, etci never did well in school because i never spent any time studying, my mother watched 6 kids 2 cousins, 3 siblings and then myself so she was too busy to make sure i was getting assignments turned in. my dad worked full time manual labor and he was always too tired when he got home and i never wanted to bother him on his days off.fast forward to sophomore high school, my dad gets nonhodgkin lymphoma and deteriorates rapidly. he passes a little after my 16th birthday. i end up dropping out and working part time jobs.i was dating a girl who still to this day i feel like in a universe or reality that i was not shit, i would have ended up with her. i still talk to her sometimes and she is awesome, but she has her own life now.anyway, she ended up leaving around the same time my dad passed away so between working first job was at gamestop, and yeah it was fucking awful i would spend most of my time in my room listening to postal service and crying.i tried to get back into school, ended up taking some community college classes. dropped out, came back, dropped out etc i am not sure how many times between the ages of 18 to 21. when i was 22 i started dating again, and the first girl i slept with i ended up getting pregnant. i was always taught do not have sex because it will make jesus cry and i kind of did not really give a fuck about that. what should have been said was it will kill your youth and leave you an empty broken person or at least, that is how it was for me.we talked and decided she should have the baby and she came to live with me at my moms house what a catch i am right and i supported her through her awful pregnancy lots of morning sickness, etci end up getting a job at safeway and a friend teaches me how to drive and loans me enough to buy a shitty car that lasted me about 2 years.so by this point i am 25ish and we move in with our son to a new apartment. i am actually in school and doing well this time and she is working as a bartender. i finish school by the time i am 27 and graduate with an associates in paralegal studies.just about right after i find a new job using my degree she stops working. i bugged her about working or going to school constantly because i felt like you should always be striving to improve? or something. just sitting at home while i am working is kind of shit because the entire time we were together i was either working or in school.during this time in our wonderful life together, she brings home an older korean gentleman and fucks him on our bed. we had an argument over her not doing anything and she went to the bar she used to work at and decided that is the best thing for her to do i guess.we worked through that. i had this idea of having a nice family and i made so many decisions because of this. the year before the pandemic i tell her that i am going back to school to get a bachelors because i do not earn enough for us to live with just me working. so that means we will have to move back in with my mom which she did not like. i was kind of in the tough shit mood because i was doing all the heavy lifting. right before i started going to class my grandmother passed away and left me a bit of money. i always wanted to go to japan and so did she my then fianc so we took a few week trip and it was fun.so about a year into me going to school she has a meltdown and tells me that i do not give her enough affection which, she could have been right but my idea of affection was providing. i always told her i did not care what she did after i graduated, but until then she should at least contribute.she ends up leaving and moving in with her friends. then from there she ends up meeting a girl and becomes the third person in that relationship. she leaves me to take care of our son. she would rather be getting fucked by two people than even attempting to be a good mom to him. i mean she was never a great mother, but kids do not really understand that. i have long since had the mom is not coming home talk with my son but he still says stuff like when mom comes back etc and it kills me.so for about the past few months i have been living in this pure agony. she will call him every day or so, but i want absolutely nothing to do with her. i feel like if there was not a child involved it would be a clean easy breakup. i have dealt with breakups before. the idea that i am chained to this woman through him is so fucking aggravating. she texted me saying she was going to come pick him up and have him stay the night with her she lives an hour away i said the fuck you are, as long as i have known her she spends most of the day getting high and i know she is living with people who grow their own weed. so yea, fuck that. also she cannot drive and i do not want this lady i do not know driving this kid around.i obviously care a lot for my son, but i have realized just how meaningless everything truly is. i wish i would have made better decisions, maybe not had a child with a psychopath.i am an average looking dude who had horrible acne and still does and i have realized that when i get acne it always leaves a scar on my body. the ones on my face i do not touch, but the ones on my body will pop just from sleeping and those always leave nice bright pink scar tissue.i am down about 35 pounds since april. i was 220 and last i weighed myself out of the shower i was 185. i have not been eating or sleeping much. before this i never did drugs but i have been spending just about every moment not with my son my mom has been helping me and she is wonderful getting cross faded and screaming into pillows or crying. i used to have horrible anxiety but ever since i started actively wishing i was dead i have not had panic attacks.i do not want to work again. i do not want to go back to school in the fall. i do not want to start dating again, but i would have liked real help raising him. i feel so guilty bringing a child into this shitty fucked up world. the only thing stringing me along is the thought of what my son will have to go through when i am gone. id like my mother to take care of him and not his drug addled mother.ultimately i feel like i wasted my entire life. i know success can be measured in different ways but what do i really have? i have no friends. i am in an insane amount of debt and my body is falling apart. i am starting to lose my hair and i cannot grow a beard due to genetics. the only thing id be willing to accept is a reset button. i believe that when you die that is it just lights out and that sounds so much better than what i am feeling daily.i know where this is heading. i cannot afford to keep going to school now that she is gone because i exhausted everything i had because i thought someday she would give a fuck and start working but yea that never happened.id rather be dead than work in a grocery store for minimum wage while single handedly raising my kid. i know he will miss me when i am gone, but all this shit is meaningless anyway. the universe will have its heat death and that will be itim sorry if anyone actually read all this. i should have made better choices. i do not want to get help, i do not want to get better. the bottom line is i need to go back in time. anything other than that means nothing to me. i am not going to be killing it in my mid to late 30s, its fucking over for me.on my 30th birthday i am going to go to a bar with my full bottle of trazadone, drink a shit ton and then down the pills in the bathroom. i wrote a will and i am ready to end this agony thinking of ending it on my 30th birthday",Suicidal

47817,my 19 year old brother has depression. background my brother is much younger to me and the youngest of four siblings. he has been dealing with depression and ibs since the age of 15. he is also suicidal when it gets worse. he is on psychiatric medications. we are a very dysfunctional family where my father turns everyone's life into hell to the extent possible. my mother has severe depression too. current situation so after two years of treatment my brother isn't getting any better. there are periods when he does fine but then relapses into depression. his ibs also gets worse and it bothers him a lot. he is in general very introverted and doesn't let anyone know what he is feeling except for occassional aggressive outburst where he is extremely angry and out of control for usual problems like his ibs. my father is currently using financial abuse to torture my mother and brother who are financially dependent on him. but i am stepping up to help my brother financially and i tried counseling him and assuring him that i will take care of him no matter what. but his condition is not improving. he said he feels terrible that he is not able to be normal and do normal activities like going to college regularly or making friends etc. i told him that everyone's normal is different and he should work as per what feels good to him. that day he was fine for sometime but again withdrew to his room where he stays in complete darkness the entire time. it's been 56 days now. i have fixed a new psychiatrist's appointment for him and he agreed. but i want to know what else can i do in this situation. i want him to be fine and happy but nothing seems to work and he is 19 so we can't force him to do anything. should i just let him take charge of his life and hope for him to get better? or is there something more that i can do? no one else in our family is bothered or emotionally attached to him so it's just me. all advice would be helpful. thanks!,Depression

because when am i going to say the thing that make her hate me it feel like i have to do everything right to be social or maybe i m missing something that everyone else ha or maybe i m just not cut out to be social but to have friend you have to answer them when they fucking text regardless of what s going on in my life and i just don t have the energy to keep up with that i recently had someone tell me i wa probably not doing well on bumble bff because i m a slow responder sometimes i don t know what to say sometimes word aren t happening in my brain sometimes i m just too tired maybe missing out on social thing for all of my 0 s is something i m never going to be able to recover from amp x 00b i ve been in a lot of workplace where i wa the loser i had no friend i d catch people saying mean thing about me they all get together with each other and i m not invited i ve been in multiple situation where group of people don t like me and do shitty passive aggressive thing to me every chance they get i don t know what i do wrong i try to just be a genuine kind person i get feedback that i m nice i know i m not perfect but at least i ve had some feedback that i m not totally delusional to think i m a nice person but there have also been a few time where i know what i said there have been a few time when i can pinpoint the off comment that make someone turn on me and it must be more than one off comment because it s always easy for that person to get a group to turn on me it s terrifying to feel like at any moment i can slip up and someone will just decide i m not worth their time amp x 00b and i never feel like i say the right thing some of my coworker s response are lackluster think lol and i just wonder if she even want to talk to me making friend give me the same anxiety that trying to date someone give me that s kind of fucked up i should probably not care so much whether or not someone decides they want to be my friend but also it affect me i feel like i m not worthy of friendship because so many people have decided i m not worth their time and honestly this is a big moment for me because this is the moment i realize i ve internalized all that rejection and got to where i don t feel good enough for friendship why would someone pick me when i m a ball of nerve why would someone want to hang out with someone who only feel like half a person

letting myself slip into negative thought pattern this week i haven t been feeling the overwhelming cloud of misery because i finally got medication that isn t expired and i m taking it regularly but every time i think about social stuff it just give me this squished feeling i can t name the feeling but it s visceral my body feel shitty i m going on a vacation with my mom and her work friend in a month and i m so fucking nervous because what if i do the thing that make everyone hate me i don t even know what the fucking thing is but spending four day with people who are talking crap about you in a small space i did that around this time last year and it wa so bad amp x 00b okay amp x 00b i m a solution oriented person and part of my problem is that i don t know how to fix this part of my life i don t really know what the solution is to feeling unworthy of friendship it took me eight year to figure out the solution to hating myself and honestly even though it s a struggle it s also worth it to fight through those feeling and find an even timbre social situation are just approached totally differently from a mental health perspective i ve googled how to feel le lonely and the fucking answer wa make friend how do you make friend when you feel like nobody want to be your friend and for good reason therapist have basically told me to find a group and the friendship will happen naturally but there s not a huge meet up scene in my area and i have a ton of anxiety about going to one and the few i have been to were not great i couldn t read the book on how to influence people and never feel powerless again i got halfway through it and it honestly felt like customer service kiss as bullshit but this time i m not even getting paid for it that book make me feel like i have to scrub my personality clean and poke myself into a small box to be socially acceptable amp x 00b i just don t know i m going to keep trying different thing i m going to keep putting myself out

18978,"hey guys, first time posting on here but i feel it is best to get my thoughts out and maybe have some insight from others as i keep a lot of my thoughts inside in person and tend not to share anything with anyone.i first asked the question 'what is the point in life' when i was around 11 to my mum, she did not give me much of an answer and i cannot even remember what she had said so it could not have been much. when i asked that question it was not me feeling suicidal but just being generally interested but i can remember it very well being the first time i felt truly sad and extremely depressed and almost scared, the world completely changed. after a while, i forgot about it completely until i was 16 which is when my mum amp dad sadly passed away shortly after one another, not related deaths and both were unexpected which made it more shocking. a few months after my dad passed i was contemplating suicide, not because i was sad about them passing, i felt i got over it fairly quickly which may sound odd but instead because i could not quite wrap my head around the point of life.i came to the conclusion after endlessly looking into philosophy and general interest in the subject that life is inherently meaningless and in the end we will all die and eventually be forgotten which in itself is bleak and sad. there is of course the argument of there is absolutely no way of knowing the meaning of life, i agree i do not know but i feel at my core that it is completely well and truly meaningless and once we die, it is done, simply done and we will not even know it is over because there will be nothing.this brings me to now, i go through periods of feeling better and then go through really dark, horrible periods such as the one i am having now where i constantly think of ending my life, hurting myself and feeling extremely sad and angry at the fact, at least my fact that life is worthless which kills all joy, all motivation in my life for periods that can be months upon months and what makes me even more mad is that there are others that may not even think anything about life and are so much more happier and enjoying life more than me. i of course am not wanting everyone to suffer, but it just upsets me further that i cannot seem to make myself think that way and simply relax and accept that fact and get on with it i guess.i am truly considering ending my life now as i cannot seem to be happy, i do drag my family down as well as my girlfriend down, she has said to me if i cannot change we will need to end our relationship as she does not want to be sad forever which is obvious and i do not blame her.i am not sure what to do anymore, the constant existential thoughts are very intrusive and it is not as simple as just 'stop thinking about it' as i know that is what most people will do, they simply do not think about life being meaningless and get on with their day but i cannot do that. i am thinking it may be best to speak to a therapist of some sort as there may be a problem with me deeper down?thanks if you have read this, i know it was a lengthy one. existential crisis leasing to suicidal ideation",Suicidal

15556,"22 yo m, moved to a new state halfway across the country with a sort of friend from middle school, i say sort of because the only context of us hanging out was either to smoke a blunt or just at a party, i have always been cool with him but we have never been like best friends or anything. i am posting this because although he is my roommate i still feel incredibly alone. through this time spent alone being about the last year or so of total isolation before we got a lease about 3 months ago i have learned that i do not really have any friends. none of my close friends from home have even called me or texted me hardly. in response to this i have left all groupchats and anything else involving them as i should not have to be friends with them just because we have hung out for 10 years or so, especially if they do not care about what i am doing or how i am doing, constantly i am seeing them check on eachother and it makes me feel incredibly left out, but it makes me think that maybe they just do not think that i needwant to be checked on. whatever maybe this is a hole only i have put myself in, but i still think if i even did have one true friend someone would have asked to come hangout. i moved to a pretty tourist destination place with legal weed so all my homies when i initially moved here all said they wanted to plan trips and yadda yadda yadda of course none of which ever was actually an intention. my roommate however has had multiple friends make time to come out here and spend time with him. maybe i am a fucking sack of shit and i just do not see it. my issue is not wanting my friends back. i have decided to just grow myself and my abilities, but all i have been is depressed and unmotivated and self loathing. i have no flame within me anymore for any sort of creative passions or ideas even. i just want to know how to meet people, covid has made things weird and i went actively looking on friday to multiple bars in my area only to find that i was the youngest at just about every one. i do not know what i need really, certainly not mentally in a place to have a girlfriend although the comfort of having that would obviously be nice but what kind of woman wants a man who is depressed and unmotivated with no plans. currently my day to day routine since i was also fired from my job as a office administrator has been wake up, shower, gym, eat, shower, lay in bed and stare into the void and take depression naps. i have tried drawing on my ipad or making videos and i just end up sitting at my desk with my head in my hands thinking about what if i died and how peaceful that may be. in death there would be no stress to have these connectionsrelationships, i feel like part of me feels that it is a massive flaw to need others simply for my own maintenance it feels incredibly dependent and i hate that. i am always willing to give myself and all of my attention and help to anyone i would think is a friend and never in my life have i felt that reciprocated, never have i felt like a bullet would be caught in return. i am a simp for human connection and i feel that with this literal entire year without minus a couple tinder dates i feel so bad almost sick. i do not know if this is a rant or what but i would appreciate tips for anyone who maybe has been in this place before and what helped you get through. 22yo feels like the end already.",Depression

9485,"hey, everyone. first off, i will start by saying that this is my first post here, so do please let me know if i have broken any rules with it.secondly, to give some context and to also let off some steam, i am pretty sure i have been depressed one way or another for a very long time now. i have never been diagnosed bythebook, but every therapist i have seen so far has pretty much let me know that it is there. from what i have read and discussed with them, my best guess is that i have something related to dysthymia, although i would say i am generally pretty functional it is like having an autopilot which allows me to go through the daily routine while being miserable and hopeless there is no official diagnosis because the therapists i have seen do not like applying labels and have not considered it severe enough to recommend a psychiatric evaluation.i occasionally get an episode which is worse than the norm. i mostly always feel a sense of generalised hopelessness and sadness, but the episodes feel like i am thrown down a bottomless pit of despair. i am currently going through one of these episodes as a result of recently having done a sumup of my life during the past few years.my problem right now, and the reason why i post this here, is that i feel that my support group, my few close friends to whom i have only relatively recently started opening up about this, have started trying to persuade me that my depression's incorrect, somehow. i have been thinking pretty much all day that maybe i am just too sensitive at this particular point in time and maybe i am reading too much into it, but i keep feeling minimised and invalidated when talking to them stuff like you have an incorrect view of yourself, you are being overlydramatic, i am sure things are not as bad as you see them, maybe you have some form of dissociative disorder this last one came straight out of left field, since all of the therapists i have seen so far have, at one point or another, remarked my fervent insistence on keeping facts and reality as straight as i possibly could. all of these just. hurt, especially knowing my history of deepdiving into my thoughts and realising that most points which because me my unrest are conclusions drawn according to objectively negative and damaging experiences from throughout my life.do not get me wrong, i know depression does not really allow for objective perspectives, even less so during an intense episode, but everything they say just makes me feel like they are not even trying to take it seriously, even for a second.they are currently insisting that i join them for a group call to discuss magical realism an attempt at a joke, i assume, but i really do not feel like that kind of invalidation and minimisation's what i need right now. my question, thus, is how do i deal with this? am i taking things too personally, is this entire thing just another element of my episode? if not, how could i politely explain this to them without them having a kneejerk reaction? i am honestly reticent to broach the subject because i expect they will lean even harder onto that incorrect perception of mine and i really do not want to upset them more than i clearly am doing with my episode. hard enough to open up about it in the first place. thank you for taking the time to read through all of that, and thank you in advance for any advice you could offer. in need of advice for dealing with minimising friends",Depression

years and gradually getting worse. i am on a slow decline in health and will do a more detailed writeup of my life and issues soon. i see death as an option to free my body of its ailments and the stupidity that caused it, had i not hurt myself i would be taking a different path but im pretty much disabled now and have tried to fight the healthcare system with no diagnosis and been labelled as crazy by every person i meet. i wont sing, dance, look or feel the same way again so for me thats not worth it. i always dreamt of doing those things but now i will never be able to do them efficiently. i dont see death as a bad thing, just terrifying and really hard to process and a way to get out of a shitty life, i would rather die than be in a lot of situations really because we all die anyway i dont really want to suffer for too long. and the world doesnt care because it will just keep spinning. so there arent any negative feelings just logical and impartial situation which i accept. everyone will die too so rather sooner than later. otherwise i would have a degree in performing arts or music by now and would be performing and doing things with my life. sadly that isnt the case and am stuck with an illness that isn't getting better. my face is swollen and so is my body, my wounds won't heal, i can't exercise and feel fatigued every day, my veins bulge and i have extremely pale skin, my eyes are also bulgingmy brother pointed this out to me and i thought i was the only one who thought this, my teeth are cracking and my gums are pale, numbness in every single part of my body, blood pools, anhedonia, and dissociation, impaired memory and i can't even count or decide what to eat, have to double check my spelling and memory and even then i forget, bathroom struggles, insomnia, weak bones, head feels full and swollen, fingernails have started to club believe it or not, hair and nails don't grow, blue extremities and struggling to breathe, cant hold head up and body feels very heavy to carry, sharp pains around my body aching pains, blurred vision and double vision, i can't even walk anymore and my ligaments crack all the time. pre 2017 this would not have been the case because i injured myself very severly and do not realise the damage i have done. doctors are saying nothings wrong with me but thats not true, the problems have built up over time which i suspect is a problem with my vascular system but getting seen in the uk is very hard. i have also bought a healthcare plan which is not private health insurance but all that i can afford11 monthly. the extent of damage it has done to me made me realize that i may not ever be normal again if i ever get treated that is, and so i feel like my only option is to die. i know some people say that people who are crippled and have disabilities can have long satisfying lives but that is not the life for me, especially considering there was nothing wrong with me before. i always dream to be that way again but i know i won't get that anymore and i wont be happy at all, the damage it has done to me probably affected my brain to the point where i dont think it will ever recover, or my heart, or my bones, or my optic nerves so i don't think it's worth living if i have longlasting complications. and also the cause was selfharm, i know it sounds silly but it could have been prevented. i was mentally ill and the things i did weren't normal, looking back at it now and it's all my parent's fault, they convoluted my idea of normal since i was a little kid. i never got the help i needed not even for my selective mutism and now i'm screwed for good. i'm no good anymore and worthless, i can't even make or remember memories and this isn't the depression speaking since i had an urge to fix my life and get back on track. now i have a wound that will never heal. my parents were extremely toxic and detrimental since my youth, my only fantasies were ones of running away. i don't have much contact with them and am stuck in the house with them. in 2017 i selfharmed so bad my left side went number and weaker and i have been that way ever since. now it's caused so many problems because of something pressing on my vascular system causing harm to my entire body, but i am told there is nothing wrong with me, even by the most toxic people of all my parents they got so sick of me trying to reach out for help, my father shouted at me and sent me into a burst of tears, i choked on my tea but i persisted and called the doctor and asked for an appointment, he took me to the docs but i feel like i'm in a losing game. i don't really have any positive options anymore and am in so much pain 247. i've lost my sight somewhat, hearing, function, mobility, emotions, and cognition and am basically becoming a vegetable. even if i do get treated it will be too late as the damage has left permanent wounds. i've shown someone pics before and they have admitted its pretty messed up what i have been through. i am struggling for answers but at the least, i can get a diagnosis just so i can shove it in people's faces and prove them wrong. but other than that i just don't know what to do with my life anymore. i got tired from making this post i took a few breaks and am still lethargic. my doctor that i recently visited also noticed that i was looking a bit pale so for me thats been a relief, he was quite attentive and offered to give me a blood test which is next month so i have to struggle to next month. he weighed meim 48kg now and we talked about my symptoms and i did mention to him it has to do with my vascular system, it's now a test of time to see what will happen. realistically i don't think my prognosis is too good. but people are becoming more attentive to how messed up my body is so i think thats a good but far too little too late now",Depression

51905,"4 years ago i wasnt showering for months at a time, depressed, anxious and paranoid. at the time i was sober going on 18, 19 years. i was, and am on disability since 09' for schizoaffective bipolar type disorder. for the longest time, especially since sobriety, i've been overwhelmed with thinking. space, time, behavior, tornadoes.whatever. but, since my life was an unmanaged train wreck i had no confidence in myself as having any quality. it seems that feeling good about yourself comes from a well managed life. my last job was as a janitor on the army base near by roughly 5 years ago. i couldnt handle the pressure. i was so dependant on others for everything i was asking if i was sweeping properly. very bad mindset. a lady mentioned crying and it made me feel like crying. i didnt understand how that could be. it seemed like witchcraft, so to speak. that was my last day at my last job. it was my 4th attempt to go back to work since my disability badge acquisition! i've been in therapy for 16 or 17 years ago i got into therapy from a mental health episode. during that visit at the crisis stabilisation unit in virginia fredricksburg i met a man that changed my life. he went by the name bose uncle. he taught me a breathing exercise. 3 in 6 out. you breath in deep for 3 seconds roughly then out for 6 seconds. also roughly. dont try to be specific like me and do it exactly 3 and 6. on down the road, life and me under pressure and practicing my breathing because sufferage bleep blop bloop, pandemic. overwhelming, unadulteraded pain in the brain from an anxiety i'd never expierenced before i saw a vision. it seemed to be the exact same thing that happened to bill wilson from aa. a wind blew through me. his words. my words on it are, i was no longer a bound up point in time and space holding on to the memories from the stimulation from the moment. i was free from the tension that came about from the fucking utter bullshit that exists. i let it go. the moment. i stopped holding and figuring. ampx200b it was like my being afraid got wore out. i remember specifiaclly saying to myself at the height of my pain in a ridgid bodily posture laying in my recline, bullshit. i calle dbullshit on my old beliefs. that old fire and brimstone god. intstead i chose my concept of life as my god. my ideas are good to. changed life. about six months later i nearly died from pancreatitis. when i got home from 6 days in the hospital i shared it on facebook. i received a good number of get well soon messages as expected. i did not get what i thought i would. people coming to visit, bringing me food.all that. i nearly fucking died. i know hundreds of people. what does that mean? my perception is fucked up, my beghhvior is fucked up, i need to change. i did not think that way at first. at first i thought, i fucking hate everyone. for a while. then 6 months later, i got diagnosed with autism. april 24th 2021. 6 months later after learning to relax, i rested on my heels for the first time in my life. this began the second chapter of my life. the taking my time portion. the i am the most impotant person in my life to me. you all come second. for ever. i no longer run to the kitchen, the bathroom, through the grocery store, drive fast, or move my limbs fast. i have even taken control of my eyes speed of movement. did you know that your body can control your mind. if you dont control your body your body will be controlled by your environment throught the mind. you receive stimulus simply due to being a sensing being. this moves you. if you are not aware of it. make yourself aware of this and take control of your body, the way you look, smell, move behavior speed amplitude of voice .total bodily control and you can eliminate a great deal of your own suffering. i havew come off my depression meds and greatfully have finally been more aptly medicated with litium. now i dont have to force myself into slow mo behavior but i do stay aware i think from a bit of fear. you can control your thinking! you can control your thinking! ampx200b i wish i could impress upon whomever needs it that the pause in conversation is ok. moving the body oddly slow is not odd. not speaking is an answer. and, you dont owe a motherfucker a goddamn thing if it stresses you out. peace in east!",Anxiety

7226,"i spent 2 hours writing a post on here until my phone glitched and deleted it all. then i realized i was over sharing amp decided not to type it all out again. it was good therapy venting to myself anyways.7 months ago my newborn son passed away, 2 days before his 1 month birthday. he stopped breathing in his sleep, spent 9 hours at er amp then passed away in my husband amp is arms. i thought i was doing better but these past few weeks have been miserable. i was told prior to conceiving him and after 4 miscarriages that i had pcos and probably would never be able to conceive or have a pregnancy success. i found out two days before mothers day 2020 that i was having him amp i named him after gabriel the messenger of god. he was the most amazing thing to ever happen to me and the most beautiful thing i had ever seen in my life. i wish every day i was the one who died instead of him.i am only 20 years old, yet i feel as if i have been through so much. i feel like god is punishing me in my life and i can never be happy. i do not understand why he had to cut short the life of a beautiful baby. i cannot eat, i am always tired, i am always reliving the moment my husband runs into our room screaming hes not breathing.every night i fall asleep to images of what i think he would look like now. i am trying to conceive again to no avail. i want to be a mother so badly but no other baby will be like him, and my body will not cooperate regardless. i do not want to kill myself but i feel like i have nothing to live for anyways.he saved my from a severe eating disorder amp addiction. he made me grow up and turned me into a woman. i moved out, i got my shit together, my husband and i got married so my baby could have a happy home.i will never get to see him take his first steps, say momma for the first time, get to give him his first taste of sugar. i was so excited to take him to the beach, i bought a swimsuit that was several sizes too big so he could wear it in the summer. its in his closet with the tags still.i sleep with his onesies in our king size bed. i wish it was him instead . i do not know why i am posting this, i have had reddit for a long time and have never made a real post. maybe i am looking for people to relate to or maybe this is a cry for help. i do not want to die but i want something to live for and i want a sign that my baby is okay amp watching over me. i wish i knew for sure. i think this whole experience has made me more religious because i know he was too pure and perfect to go anywhere else other than heaven and i hope one day i will finally be okay amp get to see my boy again. if anyone knows how i can move on or find some peace i would love to hear it. thank you for reading this amp best of luck on your journey to happiness. i have not found mine yet but hopefully i will feel that joy he gave me again. tw i cannot get over the death of my baby.",Depression

29317,"i won't go into too much detail but what stems off of that is thoughts of being and feeling worthless like i'm not good enough for anyone and that i'm undeserving of the good things given to me but then another thought stems off of that one which would be something along the lines of me thinking how stupid i was acting and then another thought after that and so on. another little thing i'd like to add is that that i seriously struggle seeing my own self worth and how much i mean to my friends and family who are all amazing by the way i love them all so much. eventually on fairly rare occasions those thoughts tend to lead to depression, paranoia that people around me hate me and don't want anything to do with me, dissociation with reality and then finally the rock bottom of that would be thoughts of suicide though i've never acted out on these thoughts or would ever want to and the occasional anxiety attack where i feel nauseous, my heart beats really fast, my limbs feel like jelly, heavy breathing, i feel panicked and i just want to get out of the situation as quickly as possible. other than that though i'm quite optimistic and i tend to be a genuinely upbeat and happy person! i'm seeing someone about these problems but i just thought i'd ask if anyone has any extra advice they could give if things start to get a bit out of control.",Normal

11030,"background info there is something wrong with me where when my stuff is moved around or organized differently it makes me freak out its such a horrible feeling. idk why, it makes me have this huge rage i cannot control and flail my body around and it always makes me want to sh a ton but i cannot bc my parents know i sh and check. my parents have organized my rooms lots of times without telling me and every time it becomes some huge fight. my room gets messy a lot because of my depression and my parents get upset about it and stuff. i am 18 and i cannot afford to move out even though my relationship with my parents would be 10x better if i could. i was on vacation for a week with a friend of mine and i was excited to get back. my moms appendix ruptured when i was gone, and every single day i would bike out far where i could get service just so i could check up on her. before i got back i called my dad and i asked if anything was organized differently bc i really did not want that and i woukd rather know in advance. he said no. but when i got home, a bunch of my stuff have been hung up on my walls. to a normal person this probably is not a big deal but for me for some reason it makes me feel like my skin is burning and the world is ending. i cannot control it and i do not know why. one was my art project i worked on for weeks. so i tore it all down, and i very carefully tried to take my project down and it ripped on the side. that makes me so upset it was my favorite thing i have ever made. so i walked into my parents room and was flipped out and i was like there things on my wall when you told me you would not, and my project ripped. they got very mad and just told me to leave. the next day i went to talk about it. it was the biggest fight we have ever had. and i tried to explain my side and i apologized for getting upset, but explained i am very frustrated bc idk how to fix my project and they know this makes me upset and it has become a pattern. they yelled at me and said things like do you know how much we do for you!and i said yes and i appreciate that but i am just trying to explain this. they also brought up how one time they had to reorganize my room because i was going to the mental hospital and that they did not have a choice, i said i understand that and i am not upset about that expect for the fact that when they cleaned it that time they threw away a letter from my best friend that i had to dig up from the trash. they go do you think we wanted to have to dig through your room looking for things you could use to cut yourself! and your room was disgusting and it was like a horders room! i was extremely depressed at the time, so yes my room was a mess but i was to depressed to care at the time its not like that anymore. like i am sorry i am a burden to the whole family. clearly i hate myself already. they did not have to be so mean. i do not know what is wrong with me but i wish they would have just talked about it instead of yell at me and say mean things. i am so fucking tired of living and so tired of not being able to sh. i just got in a huge fight with my parents",Depression
35504,"last month filled with illness and anxiety, not being able to sleep well, and surgery possibly coming up. need advice on how to cope. i've had really bad panic attacks and anxiety since i was around 14, up till the age of 16. after my first major panic attack, i was hospitalized for a week, after which they concluded it was anxiety and referred me to a psychiatrist. ampx200b i've essentially been free of panic attacks since, but have had periods of anxiety, centered around my health. ampx200b the last month has been especially terrible. it started with an eye infection that caused an eye edema, where my left eyeball developed a dent and a bump. the ambulance ride was nervewracking, and i was given antibiotics at the er and then discharged. ampx200b then, i got stomach flu. terrible week. i felt weak, dehydrated, and completely sapped of all energy. more antibiotics, i felt better after a few days. this is when i started to become hyperaware of my heartbeat. ampx200b then, i got sick again for 23 days fever, cold, sore throat. had some relief, but then went out on the weekend, walked home in skimpy clothes in freezing cold and rain, bronchitis for another week. ampx200b last week, i started getting wisdom tooth pain. it's an infection and abscess. dentist said i need to have it pulled. terrified of the surgery, and especially the anesthesia. haven't had it before, scared of an allergic reaction or complications. dental anesthesia can briefly cause palpitations, which sucks because i'm so worried over the health of my heart. ampx200b around 4 weeks of constant healthrelated drama, worrying, palpitations, panic. the worst is probably the poor sleep. i cant fall asleep easily because i keep checking my heart rate and freak out when it slows down. my resting heart rate is around 60, so i really freak out when there's a long time between beats. this leads to palpitations, poor breathing patterns, tingling, twitching, you name it. ampx200b tldr four weeks of infections, anxiety panic, worrying about my heartbeat and shit sleep, possibly getting wisdom tooth surgery, terrified of anesthesia and related complications. i'm tired and need advice on how to cope.",Anxiety
