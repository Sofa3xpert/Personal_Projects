15150,"so, some back story. i am 27 f and this person 23 m, my younger brother i believe has threatened me during a very heated verbal fight. for our entire lives, he has smashed walls, kicked walls, punched walls, broken things, all the time. he stomps the floor when he hears people walking past his room because it pisses him off and smashes the ceiling above him when he hears his family, including me walking around upstairs as he works out downstairs. he constantly always has had rude responses and is always extremely disrespectful and demeaning when someone is trying to just be civil with him. i have ruled it out over the years and he has abusive actions. he shows silent treatments, holds you accountable for your weaknesses. there is never any wining against him. he has destroyed most of the house. we get in heated fights often. today, i left my room as he was getting ready for work to see what he was up to and i proceeded to tell him to cleanup his dishes in the kitchen and to clean them because i was sick of cleaning up after him all weekend and this is where it began, he freaked out and told me i do not do anything, meanwhile i cleaned the house all weekend, cleaned after his mess he leaves on the counters. i proceeded to tell him to be respectful towards me. he proceeded to tell me i am a waste of space i do not deserve to live home and i do not deserve anything and that whenever someone asks him how i am doing, he tells them i am a bitch and a piece of shit. he then told me, i deserve what is coming. i am not sure what this means but it is scary. he does own a shotgon he keeps laying on his bed with rounds and he said he is soon buying another rifle. i genuinly did feel threatened and scared, i often do around him, i often get thoughts he is going to swing open my door and shoot me in the back of the head. he has no sense of remorse or sympathy whatsoever. never answers my phone calls or texts. someone please give me your insight on this. do you think i was threatened? also, yes i am very much old enough to move out. i have struggled with ptsd my entire life and have recently been struggling with extreme anxiety and depression. and i am slowely trying to get out of an extremely hard and dangerous time in my life of self harm. this situation makes it extremely difficult to better my life and be happy, i cannot be myself here. he has always put me down for my insecurities and my past of not eating and being scared of life. he tells people i am a horrible person because of my ptsd and my weaknesses and calls me a loser. it is extremely hurtful. i have been sitting here texting a friend just trying to relax and be okay. i just do not know what to do anymore, whenever i do move out, i want to get a restraining order against him because i do not want him apart of my life anymore. i think i have been threatened by a family member i live with",Depression

34055,"i think school gave me social anxiety story is, since i was born until i was 12 i was bullied, no big deal because i am not traumatized and i am actually in good terms with my old classmates now, but, being bullied made me what people call a neet i don't mind talking to people or going outside. well, i guess i do set some limits to myself when it comes to socializing to the point i am almost always quiet i blame the school system, at least on my country, because it's made in a way that even when i moved to the us, it just isn't easy to socialize with others because you have to be quiet or talk low, this also gave me troubles with talking low usually, it's hard for me not to, well, i scream a lot when i watch videos i am kind of crazy xd but in my comfort zone only and well, i spent most of my days on a pc watching videos and having fun my parents also just don't know how to take care of a child, you see, i got depression and maybe something else thanks to my dad, he isn't abusive, he does things for a good purpose but the way he does it made me hard to tolerate him the slightest thing, even just saying a bad joke, if it comes from him it would make me mad over the line, and i don't want to feel like that but i can't avoid it, i dunno why, it's just how he made me. i also don't find anything to do outside my house and that's why i don't even ask to get out of there adding how overprotective my parents are and when i actually do want to they just don't let me i almost never go to my friends houses, i had a friend who didn't care when i went but hey, after 2 visits i couldn't anymore because of their paranoia and being overprotective, i don't hate them for that, not even mad, i just dislike how few chances i have of doing stuff like that i think i am forgetting something. i don't know. i am not diagnosed with social anxiety nor seen anyone to tell me i have that, but i dunno my man, i am trying to explain my story but it's so badly structured that i just want to get to the point, i am a neet and i am used to live on the internet just chatting with people through text messages but today, i tried vrchat and i just. couldn't talk, i wanted to, but i couldn't, most of the times i just think my voice isn't right for my words and a lot of times, i just don't know, i can't, maybe i feel insecure? i just wonder if there's a way to fix this. i don't think it's deep i don't feel pretty good now, i was getting too bored in the game and i got tired of not doing a thing in vrchat, my plan was to be a silent person and interact with people but it's hard without vr, and it still gave me the chills to interact with them. i am frustrated because my voice. it isn't bad, but i can't think of a avatar who would fit it, my own appearance doesn't fit with my voice, and even though i know many people have appearances that don't fit their voices my words, my words are just what can't get out, by just thinking how it will sound or saying it to listen to it this is annoying, i don't really hate my life, i had fun when i was 10 and didn't have any friends, just spent the whole time watching videos and playing game, and i still had fun when i got friends on the internet or people to talk to ironically, people ruined that fun a little bit xd at the price of making it more fun i am having fun now but now, well, i just handled depression i guess, but talking to people is still something hard to do for me, at least i got friends in my school, but i am still just too quiet and i am annoyed by that, i also find it almost impossible to start conversations, or just impossible but, without speaking. meh, it feels like there's no risk, i dunno, when i type i don't think i could mess up, not because of my voice, but it's still pretty hard, but i think that's how it is usually, hard i wanna add that my family aren't something i can call friends or people to talk to, they have a lot of issues that are responsible for who i am now, i also almost never talk to them, specially when i just think there's nothing to talk about with most people actually, but there's a fewer amount of topics with them and well, that's my thing, i just want to know if there's something i can do, sorry for wasting your time, this is a mess, i don't normally make such a mess when i type stuff but this is one of the things i found the hardest to talk about not emotionally, i usually make a mess when i find things hard to explain or to type, but this one is just the worst xd oh well at least i am not always like this, there are times where i just have energy",Anxiety

12601,"i 17nb have been dealing with depression and anxiety for the past 5 years. at the end of this school year, i thought i was finally cured i thought i found my purpose, rediscovered hope, and made really good friends. that all came crashing down when a relative passed away due to the current worldwide issue. for the past two weeks i have been feeling the worst i have felt in a long time. the relative who had passed away was not very close to me herself, but her passing changed my parents and turned them verbally abusive and now i hide in my room all day to avoid talking to them so i do not get screamed at for the most mundane reasons. along with night terrors which i have been dealing with for months, i have been crying daily, and have been not letting myself sleep and isolating myself from many of my friends as a form of sh since my mother checks my skin daily. moreover, i did not even notice at first but i started restricting and then binging and this style of eating mixed with my lack of sleep and anxiety about my home life landed me in the hospital for newly developed health issue.anyways, i have started trying to manage my issues. i set controls on all my devices so that they do not let me use any apps from 11 pm to 7 am, and i have also been making myself eat 5 really small meals per day so i can keep everything down while eating enough. the only issue i have been having is reaching out to my friends again. i am in the bay area, and restrictions are easing despite the increasing cases and new strain concerns. i managed to open myself and my issues to a really understanding friend of mine, and he invited me to go to sfo with this group of friends, and while i am glad to have been invited, this trip is causing me so much anxiety and i really need an outsider's opinion.on one hand, i really want to go. i have not been around people in so long and i feel like if i do not talk to someone who is not in my family i might explode. on the other hand, while this friend group has been nothing but nice to me, they make me nervous. like, i am not a very popular person at school i have been kind of bullied up until like last year. this changed when i made friends with this group, who is very wellknown and quite popular, and people started treating me better. while they are all very nice, i feel insecure when hanging out with them because they have always been more popular, more attractive, and they are super close with each other so they make inside jokes and reference past trips they have made while i feel left out. once they even forget that i am with them and did not include me in a conversation for almost 3 hours. i feel like if i do not go, i am going to feel depressed and horrible that i did not go on a fun trip as teen that i can talk about once school starts and i am going to feel jealous they got to bond without me. but if i do go, and they all have a lot of fun while i am trying to keep up with the convo, i think i might burst into tears on the spot.then there is also the fact that my parents will not let me go at all, first of all because of increasing cases in the area and the new strain, but also because of my health issues mentioned above. i know this seems like a super firstworld and stupid problem but all these issues colliding into this one weekend trip is causing me severe anxiety and i feel unable to think. what should i do?tldr dealing with probably my lowest point, trying to get better, invited on a trip with sortof friends, idk whether i should go or not due to mental and physical health issues as well as worldwide issues. tw grief,slight sh, ed it keeps coming back and never ends advice would be appreciated",Depression

build my body alone take away my will to live after my gap year i continued onto my master i started to lose some weight just because i slept through some snack and meal from fatigue and then i knew that i could never gain that weight back i started to take up lot of exercising to create more room for extra food the vast majority of my classmate are thin people being bigger than everyone is extremely triggering for me everyday i wake up and think about what i m going to eat then i think about how big my leg are then i think about how much thinner and smarter and classmate are then i see all the thin people around me then i think about what i m going to eat next then i think about how i m going to fit a jog or a boxing class into my busy schedule then maybe i will think about school and such then i go to sleep and repeat it all again i even lost my damn period again it s maddening because i am not even a thin person and yet my body think that being slightly thinner mean that i m necessarily dying i have such a dumb body now here i am doing an internship for school and i am failing very badly it s not in my native language and i haven t known the language for very long so it cost me twice the cognitive energy to follow everything apparently taking exam go smoothly but the minute i have to be in a practical setting i turn into a complete idiot i don t have the extra energy to put in the effort because most of my dumb thought are just my leg are fat her leg are thin she is lucky i have to worry about weight lunch is when jogging when extra squat when what s for dinner etc now i m constantly being told that i m not performing well and they can t tell if it s because of a language barrier or if i genuinely don t understand what is going on everyone else is doing just fine and they say that you have to be pretty stupid to fail at this internship well guess who s going to be that idiot who can t pas looking back at my life i just see failure and mediocracy and just a lot of sadness a i said earlier my body alone take away my will to live but in order to be able to function in school and work you need to stay relatively healthy but seeing a my life is just filled with social isolation inferiority complex and still lot of depression there is just simply no way that my life is worth it living in this healthy body make me extremely sad and the life that i would otherwise have without an ed is just not worth it it doesn t justify the effort i put into recovery and the effort i put in with learning to accept my body seeing a my life is just consisting of studying feeling stupid feeling incompetent cry exercising restrictive eating hunger fatigue and more cry i just wonder how the hell everyone else is just out here living a normal life without any mental illness people like my classmate are really out here acing their exam acing their internship having a life having lot of friend having a relationship having fun and leading overall fulfilling life i don t understand it all i know is that my life wa just one big mistake i just really need a good plan on how to end myself i find it disappointing how finding a simple method with a high success rate just isn t very easy i have four more week in my internship i just plan to go through it get an insufficient grade and then end it all but ugh mom and dad would be so sad it s already bad enough that i tell them that i hate living and wish that i could disappear they try so hard to convince me that i m smart and can accomplish anything i want like i m in a disney movie they constantly try to convince me that i will find happiness in my life and that i m just in a low state of my life and that they will always be there and try to find further help for me but i m i ve been feeling this way for over a decade damn near half my dumb existence i feel like my soul died the minute i hit puberty i didn t experience anything traumatic i wa just dealt a bad hand in genetics i m freaking

23450,"my life has been rather difficult for the past 23 months now. i try to have joy when i can but as soon as i stop doing whatever, or it does not go well enough or i cannot stop thinking about negative stuff, my day gets ruined. again and again. i thought i was over it. i kind of was. last year life was great honestly. but it was all escapism. all i did was nutrition study, language study, food making, exercise and sleep. but then of course, i got so many constant comments about my appearance how i was ugly, that i looked like a guy and pointed and laughed at i just stopped going outside, stop making varied delicious foods, though still did the others for a bit. but even that is gone this year. whenever i try to become stronger, better version of myself, more resilient, kind, fun. i get met with so much constant push back it is getting exhausting. and nobody understands. i do not share much with my friends these days because it is just the same and so exhausting, especially to be remembered myself about all of the negatives, when i just am trying to be in the now and do what little i can to improve on myself.at this point however, i am getting worried i guess. i already attempted before. one serious attempt, and multiple smaller one which at most just gave me some temporary pain but had 1 chance of killing me really. why i am worried is that i actually feel it. the temptation, thoughts, feelings about suicide becoming as strong as back when i had my serious attempt, and i do not know how long i can go on without trying again. sadly there is no help for me. i need money to fix myself. at least some minor surgeries to fix my flaws so i can look average at least and not harassed fearing leaving the door every time, move out to a safe place instead of where i currently am which is also unsafe, have money for more than basic needs unless i save up for 6 months at a time to splurge a bit on more fun stuff like clothes i need or maybe a new game and such. just living on food, meds, basic life necessities gets exhausting.i thankfully started seeing a psychologist last week so at least i got that finally after asking for years, but it is like once a month kind of thing atm because it is a free offer and i cannot afford to pay for one myself. i also am seeing if i am stronger than before to see if i can hold a job or study again, since last i tried it went extremely bad and i broke down completely. and that is with streaming. it has a pressure like a job for me, but it has been difficult. though while it is extremely difficult to me, it has also brought the most joy to me in a long while. i feel so conflicted. especially since i am also here, feeling the pressure and just not being able to handle it as much anymore. it was the last thing i felt i could try. see if i could actually accomplish anything, yet. i feel my friends and some followers just pitied me or were curious for a bit, and now what. i am too broken to become anything ever. so why bother going on. especially since my entire life except for last year only year in my life where i actually felt happy has been overall terrible, hard, sad and filled with escapism. if i did not have streamer subs and a friend coming over soon i dunno, i feel i might have been gone already by now, or tried to be. sigh. thank you for reading. feeling like an ugly failure and that i am no good at life.",Suicidal

34026,"ibspsoriasis my story and never would have thought what was causing it! i want to share my story because i believe theres a lot people out there in my situation. when i was younger in high school, i would get diarrhea going to class, mostly happened in the morning. this was around the year 1999. i had psoriasis on my head for most of my life. it would get bad from time to time, but never went away. the doctor would prescribe an ointment that stunk like gasoline. i would put this on head and it felt like it was burning the skin off my skull. so i never really used it, just suffered as is. now back to the diarrhea issue. i went to the doctors and they did everything you could imagine. blood tests, stool tests, upper and lower gis, and the good old colonoscopy! in the end the doctor said that i was a healthy young man. so he diagnosed me with ibs. once i graduated from high school it seem to simmer down to where i never really had any more symptoms. so i figured that is was over. years passed by and once in a blue moon the ibs would come back. but the psoriasis never went away. i moved forward in my career, and in my personal life. i thought that the nightmare i had when i was younger would never comeback. boy i was wrong! one day at work after having something for lunch my captain and i had just taken off we were in the air for all of ten minutes. i looked at him and said we have to go back and land! he asked what was wrong, i replied that im going to crap my pants. so we turned the plane around and landed without incident. the next day my manager called and asked what had happened and i replied that i must have ate something i shouldnt have. months rolled by with no farther problems other then the psoriasis. i upgraded to captain and loved what i was doing. then one day, it came back only this time it didnt go away! much worse, i started taking imodium gel caps one before the flight and as prescribed as many as i need during the flight.this was a bad idea for me, but we will come back to this so off to the doctor i went and of course started to do familiar tests. only this time after all the testing the doctor didnt just say it was ibs but it also must be in my head. now its time to send me to a shrink. there i am, off work by this point sitting on a couch playing head games at the same time trying not to mess myself. after the third session i said its not in my head, no way! my wife is going crazy by this point with me not working, so off i went with the same problems back to work. the first day i tried to do one flight. had diarrhea threes times and kept taking imodium trying to fight it. i didnt even get the engine started. i went back off work. then my wife said your going to do whatever i tell you to do now! i was game because i just wanted this to be over. she sent me to a naturalpath doctor, i thought that this was going to be a joke, but played along as im willing to do whatever by this point. this ended up being a game changer for me. i told her what was happening, and she said tell me what you eat i the run of a day. i told her and she replied that it sounds like a food intolerance, and that its a simple blood test. i said that i already been tested, she replied thats for allergies. i agreed to the test. about three weeks later she calls me, say the results are in. i went to see her she said i had three different intolerances one was potatoes another was cane sugar with fruit, and the last most important.soy. that day i eliminated all three and within a week all my symptoms were gone including my psoriasis, even the little bumps on the back of my arms went away! i was so happy, the only problem now is that i have to prepare all my meals and read every label of anything i want to eat. so living on the road as an airline pilot makes it tough, but ive got it down now. soy is what was causing all my problems, and if i have it today it comes back at full fold. now remember how i said i was taking imodium gel caps, well one of the ingredients is soy. just like a car, jamming on the brakes while hitting the gas! so i had medical problems that regular doctors couldnt find, went to a naturalpathic doctor and found out that i have a food intolerance to soy.",Anxiety

26989,when i was in school i took gcse re and one of the topics we covered was about suicide and also assisted death. at time i thought suicide was bad because that is all we hear and are conditioned to believe. however in re we were looking into different religious beliefs and of course all the religions say suicide is bad but the teacher showed us a clip of a woman who was a suicide advocate and id like to add i was not suicidal or depressed while at school i thought she made some really good points. of course at the time i did not make my opinions known because everyone in class was saying how she is wrong i was only 15 at the time and did not want to be made to see some stupid school councillor or something so i kept my opinions to myself. everyone is argument against suicide in that class seemed so stupid to me after hearing what that suicidal woman had to say. i understand that when people die its sad. extremely sad when its a close friend or family. but dying is inevitable so why are non suicidal people so against suicide? id rather die on my own terms. i am extremely depressed and suicidal and i feel as though i get emotionally blackmailed to stay alive. i might sound naive but i rarely ever hear people telling non suicidal people to please stay alive. like when my dad was just randomly dying from a heart attack one day i did hear my mom say it to him but is she angry at him for dying even though she told him not to? no and that is because he had an illness which caused him to die. i also have an illness and that illness is depression which is pushing me closer to death just in this case its me wanting to die on my own terms? i know my mom would hold some sort of resentment towards me if i were to die by suicide. at the end of the day all deaths are sad and upsetting no matter how the individual dies so why are the people who are suicidal the ones who are selfish? so i have to stay alive and suffer just so you do not feel bad and get your feelings hurt? is that not selfish? what is the difference between dying by choosing suicide and dying naturally?,Suicidal

was not ready to return to my studies.this is where it all started going wrong. first mentally exhausting thing that really hit me hard was sexual harassment from my coworker. one night he got really drunk at a company party and was just really all over me. i froze completely. he said the most nasty, vile things to me and i just stood there, not knowing what to do i was not drunk. the whole event is something i still cannot even think about. the person makes me sick and i just feel sick and i feel like i physically can not go back to that night in my head. i could have reported him he had a history of sexual harassment reports but i felt like it was my fault. i started to suffer from panic attacks before work, i felt guilty about it. i felt dirty and unworthy. he continued to harass me even when he was sober. and every day at work i just pretended nothing ever happened, while i felt completely broken on the inside. after some months, i decided i need to leave that environment and i applied for a new job within the same organization. i never really told anyone what happened or dealt with it, i just pushed the whole thing aside in my head and decided to move on. i got the job i applied for and it was actually something really interesting. 200 better than what i had before. i thought it will be the beginning of something good, for the first time in my life i actually had a job that i enjoyed, that i was actually really damn good at and that felt right every day. looking back at it, i feel like eventhough all of this is true, i was not really ready to take on new challenges and the previous events were still at the back of my head like an open wound.the new department i joined is relatively new and tbh, nobody knew shit there. the amount of people working in that department went from 15 when i started to 60 within 1 year. it was, and still is, blatantly obvious that i was one of the most professional and capable person there. so they started to give me the most difficult projects. they put me in charge of developing new processes and basically teaching all the new people what to do and how to do it. i loved the topic so i never said no. the shit just kept piling and piling. more things to do, more projects, more this, more that. i told my supervisor it is getting out of control. that i am drowning. i do not have enough time in my day to do all of this. he is a cool dude so he decided to give me a promotion and a team of 5 people so i can give them some of the stuff. the problem is, these 6 people that are now in my team are new workers, and the stuff i do requires a lot of knowledge on the topic. so now i am basically teaching them everything i know and doing all the stuff i was doing before and all the new stuff that keeps coming weekly.i have not slept since november. i do not go out. i do not answer when my phone rings and my friends call, because i feel like i am just too tired to even talk. i do not want to see anyone. i am angry, frustrated. all the stuff that i kept inside my head is now coming out. i have not had my period in 8 months. i gained 7 kg in half a year because i am too tired to cook food so i just order unhealthy food at home. yesterday i had a complete melt down at work due to the frustration of not being able to read an email, because i cannot focus on anything anymore. i did not sleep all night and woke up just crying hysterically. i finally went and saw a doctor today and the diagnosis is anxiety, depression and burn out. i am seeing another one next week as well as a psychologist. it is going to be a long sick leave by the looks of it. by nature i am a perfectionist, over achiever, i set my goals super high and my standards for my work even higher. i do not know who i am trying to impress, or if i am just trying to prove my self worth by being a super human. but i feel like i disappointed myself and everyone around me. i feel like i am being unfair towards others if i take time off. i am scared shitless of being seen as weak by everyone around me. and i am so angry because i did not meet my own expectations. this is my first day of sick leave and i am already terrified of going back to work and seeing everyone. i do not know how to handle my fears, the anger, the sadness and being so god damn tired that even emptying the dish washer sounds like too difficult of a task to complete. today i decided to seek help and it scares me",Depression

34758,"terrified of catching the flu after ent visit. i've been a huge germaphobe for as long as i can remember. in the spring and summer it usually doesn't cause me to much distress, but once cold and flu season pick up, it starts to have a greater impact on my mental health and my ability to function. earlier today, i had my biyearly appointment with my ent to get my ears cleaned out i produce a ton of wax. i was super anxious going into the appointment as there is a very bad cold going around my area right now, and the flu is widespread. i took hand sanitizer with me and was prepared to grab a mask if the waiting room was busy. thankfully, there wasnt a single patient in the waiting room. i was called back quickly, the nurse took some info, i sanitized my hands, and then my ent entered the room. he shook my hand, and then sanitized his, and got to work cleaning me out. once he finished i asked a quick question about how to avoid facial and ear pain on a long flight, and he suggested the vasalva maneuver. he demonstrated it for me, and then asked me to try it. ordinarily, i dont touch my face under any circumstances, but since i had just sanitized my hands and since i was just pinching the outside of my nose i was careful not to get too close to my nostrils, i figured it would be okay. so i pinched my nose very briefly and went on my way. on the drive home i started to think about it a bit more, and realized that after i sanitized my hands, i shook his hand, so my hands probably were not very clean when i pinched my nose shut. and i started to get really worried that in doing so, i probably exposed myself to tons of coldflu germs that will infect me in the coming days. now i'm anxious as can be, trying to find some rational reason why i shouldn't be worried here, so i can calm down a bit. i havent had any luck yet. can anybody help me out here? also, just for the record, i'm seeing a therapist twice a week to help with these things. we just started back in october, but unfortunately he's been out of town all of december for the holidays. i've backtracked a good bit in his absence. i'm also more anxious than usual about getting sick because i have a vacation coming up next week and i really dont want to have a coldflu while traveling.",Anxiety

34881,"anxiety or actually ill? so i don't know where to start this so i'm just gonna get to the point. i'm an otherwise healthy 20 yo female and last week my legs started feeling very itchy. then, the itching moved upwards to my torso and arms. on wednesday i noticed two strange rashes on my arms and decided to see a doctor because the itching was just horrible. he said it's probably an allergy and that he can't do much until i figure out at least if it's food or something enviromental causing the problem, and he gave me allergy pills to ease my itching and rashes. he said to take two if the rashes reappear. so the next day, when i got another one on my arm, i took just one pill, and they stopped appearing. the next day, i took one more just to be sure and the itching and rashes were totally gone by friday. now, the problem is, on friday i thought my breathing was a bit more labored than usual. it's probably all in my brain but the feeling hasn't gone away. if i put my mind to something else, i'm fine, but as soon as i start thinking about it, i get panicky. it's been the same for 4 days now, and i'm not sure what to do about it. also, on friday, when i had lunch i ate very little until i started feeling very sick. the same on saturday and sunday. is it all due to my anxiety? i'm nervous to see a doctor because i don't want him to think i'm making stuff up, because i was just at his office a few days ago, and now i'd show up with another problem. helppp",Anxiety

9662,"i am such a retarded fuck up, you know what i am tired of hearing? i am tired of hearing my school counsellor or my soccer coach telling me shit like 'it is in your head', 'get out of your own head' and the most useless of all 'combatchallenge those negative thoughts'. surely, one would think, if they were capable of basic human tasks, i.e. not fucking up everything you do, the most basic of tasks in a sport, or talking to people, or giving people eye contact for god's sake, you would not need to artificially boost yourself esteem. because you are capable of those things, you are capable of functioning as a socialable human. you know how fucked my selfesteem is? sometimes, well actually, most of the time, i hate having a fucking shower because i hate seeing my disgusting retarded fucking body in the mirror. despite being told by some that i am too skinny, or that i am normal, etc etc. i still feel and i still am a fat fucking retarded loser. i do pretty decent at school, i got an estimated atar of 84 for year 12. i wanted to be a pilot in the raaf, but how the fuck am i ever going to achieve that if i am just an autistic bumbling piece of shit retard who cannot have a conversation with their mates one on one. i can do speeches to a class, or hell, even the school fine but when it comes to talking to someone or having a conversation, i just cannot. i literally want to kill myself as an escape. i remember early 2019 i think, i was plusoned since i never get invited to parties, not even my own friends' to a girl's party who i somewhat had a crush on if you would even call it that, i do not think i had ever spoken to her, even to this day. being the socially inept fuckwit that i am, i practically held on for mercy to my friend group as it slowly deteriorated as they spoke to other guys, and women who they did or did not know at the party. eventually i was all alone, kind of just awkwardly sitting on my phone in the corner while everyone was having fun in the pool. you want to know what i was thinking while everyone was exploring their teenage lives with girls or having fun with their mates? i thought about i could smash my skull on the edge of the pool hard enough so that i would knock myself out and drown, or how i wish, how i begged that i had a gun and could just shoot myself in the fucking head. i eventually had the nerve to walk out on the party while some of my mates asked where i was going, or that they did not want me to leave. staying at that party would have done far more harm then good i estimate, in fact i know it would have made me more depressed on the walk home then i already was going to be as i walked home. why cannot i just be normal like everyone else, is it because i am an only child who spent 90 of his childhood staring at the wall or watching tv on his own because no one was ever home? is it because i was a fat little fucker throughout the entirety of primary school, and how being picked on for being a fat cunt has subconsciously impacted by selfesteem? or was it that time in 2019 when i got completely dacked doing a pullup on the oval infront of the entire fucking school? i was already a social anxietyhaving fucking retard back then. holy shit typing this just feels good man, wow. do i have asperges? i do not fucking know. do i have social anxiety? i do not know. am i just shy? i do not know. do i have depression? i do not know. i hope i do not but i kind of hope i do at the same time so i have a reason to be so mentally fucking defective. all i know is that i have fantasized about killing myself since i was a 10 year old, and nofap has merely granted me more time to think about how badly i just want to kill myself. how bad i just want to buy a gun, or join the army and just shoot myself in the fucking skull and just obliterate my existence from this earth. on that note, i am not like most people who say they have given up on humanity and how they are turning their back on humanity. because i am not angry at society or humanity, i know i am the issue, i am the defect. i am so lonely and i love this solace, this hole that i am in, this melancholy. it feels warm, cozy, it feels like i belong here and it feels like i am here to stay. i do not give a fuck anymore, i just want to die. maybe i will regret it when i do kill myself one day. i am just so tired of being an autistic little fuckup loser. sometimes when i get mad at myself or i feel stress, i just like to rant in my head how i am so much a fucking fat little cunt fggot fucking loser, it feels good. sometimes i like to pretend i am holding a gun to my head or in my mouth with my hand and just pretend i am pulling the trigger and that i will not be here anymore. i remember when i was a little younger, i used to go sleep, making a prayer eastern orthodox and just pray that god will kill me or end my life. i am just listing my thoughts here so if this feels a little disjointed, i apologise. i just wish i could be normal, i wish i did not hate the very existence of my being, my body, my stupid ugly fucking face. i wish i could look people in the eye while i talk to them. i wish i could talk to people. i wish i could talk to girls, i wish i could feel not lonely. i have done research on how to do those things, and it just brings me back to where i started. 'it is in your head', 'get out of your own head' and the most useless of all 'combatchallenge those negative thoughts'. just read that, kind of liked how i brought it full circle. i know other stuff about helping my social anxiety and stuff, people say just talk to people or talk to strangers, even just shallow talk etc. and it will get easier. sure maybe it might, but i do not want to have to try man, i am so fucking sick of having to strive to be average instead of just 'being average'. i do not want to try, i just want to kill myself and not have to bother, just give up. some of you reading that message above might be a bit smug and say, 'then do it, nothing is stopping you, just do it, you are just going to be another statistic.' do you really think i care about being another statistic? if i had a gun, i would have already killed myself lmao. i would probably be dead in the pool or on the couch, i do not fucking know. i am listening to some radiohead and just writing these things while putting on a good album of their just feels right. i will wrap it up here, how the fuck are people cocky? how are people arrogant or become overconfident? i want that shit man, surely it is better than every thought you have in your brain is either a plea for suicide or a neutral thought which manifests itself into a negative one. anyways, that is all i can think of for now in my smug retarded essay. comment what you guys think or something so i know my block of text did not go unnoticed. or even advice, i dunno, i have not totally given up yet. thanks guys. self esteem kind of just listing things to get off my chest",Depression

21160,"a lot of us like to self reflect on the past. back when things were going great. when we had friends we cared for and the motivation to pursue knowledge. back when the world made sense, because we viewed it with a different set of eyes. unfortunately, all good things come to an end, and at this point in life we realize that things are not what they seem. all this effort goes towards nothing of meaning. our systems are causing distress, our currency is killing people and dividing nations, while simultaneously providing rich people with a bunch of excessive waste of resources. everything we are told to desire is unrealistic or unnecessary. at this point, happiness has a price, and that price is to turn your face away from everything unpleasant, ignoring the truth. blindly following corporate orders just to go home with a paycheck. this is no way to live.we had the potential to be great. a lot of us used to be intelligent, empathic and happy people. we all had our reasons for giving up, but the point is that we were able to live amazing lives, and i believe that a lot of us are able to do it again. a lot of the people on this sub are young. the competitive nature of the academic world puts great pressure on us young people. this is not a good thing, but the fact that some of us are not fully developed means that there is hope. our bodies and brains sometimes behave in weird unpredictable ways, and the truth is that we do not know a lot about it, even if it might seem like the opposite. at some point, our chemical balance could be restored. we will also learn as time passes, just like any other person, making us better at tackling the tough times. this means that we could get our lives back, although perhaps in an altered way to make up for the damage. i believe that the psyche surpasses everything else in terms of importance. an unhappy human is barely a human at all. it makes us rotten, and the negativity is contagious. it is a tough and unfair battle, so please, listen to yourself before anyone else. if you need a day, a week or even a year to become yourself again, please take the time to do so. life is short, but we do not what it to become even shorter because of the constant despair.finally, let us all remember those who did not make it. these people fought hard against nature and time, but despite their great efforts, life was simply too much. let us not grief about what has happened. let us instead remember that all of these people were so intelligent, loving and caring that the world could not keep up. instead, it trapped them in a dark hole and gave them tunnel vision.keep fighting, stay strong, and do not let nature dictate.no one can promise that it ever gets better. it might even get worse, but you never know what life has in store for you. let us all appreciate the good days that was, and the good days to come.",Depression

21504,"tw eating disorders, sexual abuserape, alcoholsorry about the long lifestory post.my parents got divorced before i started primary school, father had alcohol issues and was beating my mother she was cheating on him. then me and my sister were raised by our mentally ill mother who finally got diagnosed with schizophrenia when i was 17. grew up in an overcrowded flat where my mother and his boyfriend lived their hedonistic life listening to loud rock music, drinking beer, having lots of sex, not letting us sleep on school days, leaving us sleepdeprived as children and also traumatised as our room with my sister was a passthrough one. she could not keep a job and spent all her money on cigarettes and bought cheap candy for us to compensate for being a bad parent, she almost never cooked for us. my sister and i got fat. i was heavily bullied at school and was always a loner. i developed anorexia at 14 and was struggling with that until the age of 18, my lowest being 38 kgs. i was hospitalised as well.i was raped and sexually, emotionally abused at age 15 by a 60 drama club teacher where which my mother failed to notice even though i was staying at the club until midnight some days. when i was 18, mum had two suicide attempts, for one of them i was the one who intervened and called the ambulance. she had been in and out of hospital before then, i was spending my teenage summers visiting her in hospital. then i developed an unhealthy obsession with one of my teachers who was narcissistic and crossing my boundaries all the time the relationship was nonsexual, nonromantic, but full of tension, manipulating me and making me feel so little compared to him. this lasted for years.i wanted to escape abroad and got accepted to university there as i was doing exceptionally well in academics despite my struggles. however, my unresolved traumas were haunting me, i developed binge eating and gained 20kgs in one year, i was also spending excessively, more money than i had. i dropped out and returned home, admitted myself to mental hospital for 6 months. i was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. now i live temporarily with my dad and i am unemployed and shattered, i want to go back abroad where my sister lives but might not be able to due to immigration rules i am waiting for my results now, whether i can go back or not.i have now cut contact with my former teacher and i only used to have friends through him therefore now i have no friends. the only person i can rely on is my sisteremotionally and my dadfinancially. i see absolutely no joy in life. i am like an empty she will. i cannot choose a career as i do not think i could succeed in anything despite my excellent grades. i cannot take big responsibilities, for example, i cannot be a nurse. yes, i know the world needs doctors, but fucking hell, i would be one if i had the mental endurance. i was the mental health nurse for my frickin' mother as a childteenager for years, so no thank you. however, i generally have a huge need for being engaged intellectually, this sucks when you realise that highly intellectual jobs usually come with huge responsibility. i am also pretty creative writing, panting etc. but all of us know that is of no use in the real world. i cannot afford to take risks as i have no money, i cannot afford to drop out again, i have actually dropped out of two unis now so if i start something it has to be a thing i can actually finish. so yeah, the last month or so i have been contemplating ending it all. i have virtually no reason to live. i do not want children do not want to commit the irreversible mistake my mum made having me. life is nothing but torture for me. pure pain, devoid of the slightest feeling of happiness. never been in a relationship, even my first kiss was a nonconsensual one from my abuser, how cute! .it is not. the world is a horrible place overall. i want no more of this please. still, i cannot actually do it. it is because of my sister i think, with whom i still share a bond, even though she is far away. my whole life has been nothing but suffering",Suicidal

35348,"dealing with health anxiety for years. and how im learning to move on from it im no expert and i know everyone is different but ive come a long way with my health anxiety and wanted to share a little of what i learned. on mobile, excuse format and typos i once read something along the lines of our brain believes everything we tell it, so if we start filling it with doubt and anxiety, we create a world that is simply not true a year ago and i was telling myself every little symptom meant imminent death, i worried about brain cancer, breast cancer, blood cloths, etc etc etc. im still in the process of completely desensitize myself from the most minimal sensations and im still trying to learn how to really understand what my body is trying to tell me, this is kind of how i learned to deal with it again, i know not everyone is the same but hopefully this will be useful for someone 1. if i can distract myself from the sensation or discomfort then its anxiety, i call them sensations because any little thing i feel i wanna convince myself is pain even if its not. i try to ignore it if thats the case. my doctor always told me small sensations or symptoms are not a sign of anything serious. 2. if its interrupting your day to day then take something for your symptom and try to move on, eg, you have a sore throat then get something specifically for that 3. if over the counter meds dont do it and its well over a week or so then ill call my doctor explain whats going on and see if i can come in for some answers and peace of mind. if you have multiple terrible symptoms then of course go check with your doctor asap. but the main thing is, breathe friend. dont freak out immediately, dont google about it, try to accept the thought and the sensations as exactly that, thoughts and sensations and nothing more, theyre not a sign of anything. ironically, life is not guaranteed for anybody no matter what, but looking for symptoms constantly means youre wasting something you want to hold on to so desperately. think about that, i do it everyday.",Anxiety

24736,"well hello. i go by an alias yuta and, tldr for all my impatient friends, i would love to end it, just like that, now, once and for all, but i am too big of a pussy to decide on a method.if anyone is up for the read, welcome. i have had a pretty good life. went to a nice school in the city center, got decent grades and, even though i did not really get along with many people, i had some close friends from class. i have always been alarmingly introverted, so the few friends i had felt like plenty. then, my best friend left right before high school to study in another place, which gave her a higher chance of getting into the university that sponsored that school. parents did not let me go there as well, they wanted me to, like the whole family, study physics and math. i am incredibly stupid at both fields. two friends in class that i had left were much closer to each other and eventually excluded me from their group. i was very much looking forward to university, since school now had 0 significance to me. i passed state exams and, even though my father was hating me for what i did, i sent my documents to a movie school. got accepted. soon, he was over it. first few months of studying in 2020 felt great, i was kind of really getting into it, i have been passionate about movies since i was a child after all. then, all of a sudden, after having some nasty symptoms, i get diagnosed with ulcerative colitis, basically a few days after my 18th birthday. my parents somehow think that it will somehow cure itself, but nonetheless, i get meds prescribed by a doctor and start therapy. since then i have a strict disgusting diet, to the most of which i am allergic. 2021 comes, the symptoms start yet again but, pardon my french, i do not have anything worse other than shitting blood. my parents go absolutely crazy, cuss the precious doctor and send me to another one, she prescribed the higher dosage of the same meds, as well as the same diet. bloodshitting eventually disappears once again.i have not been out with any of my friends since my 18th birthday, i practically never go on dates with my boyfriend, because i have the pill regimen to stick to. i fail two of my projects that have to be redone in september. sincerely hoping that i will not be alive by then. after i started the new docs therapy a new weird thing appeared all of a sudden i get absolutely disgusting gut spasms at night, wake up in pain just to black out because of how bad it is. have to try falling back asleep while weeping in pain and hugging a bottle of hot water to ease the spasms. i cannot take any strong pain meds, because they might make the illness worse. so after the spasms my whole body is sore, for an entire day, sometimes two, i can barely stand or walk anywhere. today the same thing happened all over again, even though nothing could have provoked it. had spasms, woke up, blacked out, got the bottle of hot water, tried falling asleep. woke up yet again, sore all over, sides in excruciating pain even from simply breathing. was dizzy all morning, had some tea and smooth porridge for breakfast, threw everything up by 3pm, probably even the essential pills. i do not know when this is going to end. it did not get better at all. i do not think it ever will. there is no cure for it. there is no cure for me. nobody can help me. why do i have to go through all this? like, why do i even have to try if i am probably going to die from colon cancer at some point anyways? why do i have to prolong this shit and suffer through it? nothing even brings me joy anymore. i went to a psychiatrist, told him that i do not care about anything anymore, he prescribed me light pills, for anxiety. and you know what? i cannot even have them. i cannot fucking have them because of this stupid disease. i just want it to stop. only my family would care if i died anyways. i hold absolutely no significance, all i do is fucking cry over it because i am either hurting or not knowing how to end things. that is all i have been doing today too, crying, begging something to end me and throwing up. i hate it. i hate it so much. but at the same time i cannot end anything. hanging seems to be too painful and gross, i am too big of a pussy to cut or stab myself, same goes for jumping off of a roof, all overdoseable pills are sold only with prescriptions, and in terms of guns i do not have any. i also heard that drowning hurts a lot. why is there no painless ways of going? please, i just want it to stop. i want everything to stop. i do not know what to do, i do not know.props to anyone for reading through all this word vomit, and good luck. with anything. i could not even say all that to my psychiatrist",Suicidal

47552,"the life i've worked for is gone. when i was 18, i had moved out because i has a strained relationship with my family. i moved away because i wanted to put distance so that the relationship could be repaired. i ended up moving across state lines and then eventually moved down south, halfway across the country, at my father's suggestion for an easier life while i worked and got my degree. and the distance did exactly what i wanted it showed my parents that i was strong and capable and mature and that i was an adult. but it also created a great longing for home. life was easier. i got a better job, i bought a house, and i live comfortably with my husband. but. we don't like it here. we like the small city, the restaurants, the proximity, the healthcare, etc. but the environment and climate do not align with us. we are northerners at heart. we like the seasons, fall and winter, the hills, the mountains, the streams winding through the forest. we miss it so dearly it hurts sometimes. but i also miss my family. i miss my parents, my brother, my nephew. i miss my childhood best friend and her family. i am heartbroken seeing years pass and i am missing from their daily life and they are missing from mine. i am just incredibly lonely here, and i want to be with them. there has always been an obstacle preventing us from moving back, but the biggest one being how expensive it is there, and we would have struggled unless we were finished school and in our wellplaying fields. so years pass by and we stay here, while wishing we there. well now my parents are getting older, approaching their 60s. they want to retire, but they don't want to retire there, they want to retire in the state i'm currently in. so then, becomes a new dilemma do i stay in this state that doesn't make me happy, so i can be with my parents and potentially my brother in time? do i move back home and enjoy my brother's company for as long as i have it, i have my friends, my climate, and my job? either way i'm giving up something that feels nonnegotiable for my complete happiness. i'm overcome with this intense sadness that i've spent all the years where i could have had it all being away. and now they are gone and i feel as if the life i have worked so hard in my degree and in life to get back to is gone. ive tried talking to my family about staying in their current state or maybe moving to another state that i know they love and enjoy and that we do as well, and they don't budge this is their plan. i feel selfish when i push too hard. i don't know what to do. i'm overwhelmed with sadness. i just accepted a job in my career because i just graduated but its even further south and even though its an amazing career opportunity, i feel like its a step backward in the life i wanted.",Depression

35728,"i have a rabies fear, can anyone help out? this all started last june, i was playing with my dog in my yard. he lunges forward and i reached out with my hand and his tooth scraped my middle finger. it did cut the skin and i was bleeding. my finger was tingling at the site where he bit me. i went to go wash it off and didnt think much of it until i looked on the fridge and i see my dog was a week overdue on his rabies vaccine. i panicked and wasnt sure what i should do. i know of rabies, but i didnt know rabies until my dumb mind did some googling. if you know where the googling is going, then you understand my fear. if you dont, just dont worry about it. my dog at the time is a 13 year old german shepherd. he is prone to seizures and would have a couple of them a year. weve had him for 11 years so we know how to handle the situation. he also drooled and foamed a lot in the mouth. that was his natural way. hes been vaccinated every year as it is required in the state of new mexico. i did go to urgent care and received a tetanus shot since i was overdue on that one but my doctor told me that its been over 40 years since a dog had rabies in my area. so i did not receive the rabies shots. which made me feel better honestly. for about 5 months. in october, my dog was put down because he was struggling to stand up and seemed like he was in pain a lot. in late november, i got what seemed like a week long cold. sore throat, tired, drained and all that junk. i was sick but not terrible so i went to a concert and i started to feel worse. for some dumb reason, the first thing that appeared in my mind was rabies. and i almost panicked because of it and couldnt enjoy the show. i went home after feeling very horrible. i couldnt sleep, a headache kicked in, my fever rose and its like my mind was repeating the same scene over and over all night long and i couldnt sleep at all. then i woke up around 5 am with a racing heartbeat that wouldnt slow down at all. i felt awful and was fearful about rabies. since that day, i never ignored my finger where my dog bit me. i still feel pain and a minor tingling sensation where he bit me and all i can think about is if i have rabies. its practically on a daily basis i look at the spot. i have no idea how to get past this. its been 9 months since the incident and i still worry about getting it. i just cant shake this fear out of my mind. i thought the spot where he bit me would be gone but the area is still red as if its been only a couple of weeks since hes bitten me. ive tried everything, such as logic. its exceedingly rare in the us, most rabies cases have been from bats in the us or contracted outside. last person to die from a dog rabies in the us was in 1974. basically when my parents were still kids. and im 25 now. my dog survived the 10 day quarantine and we vaccinated him after those 10 days just in case. like i cant shake the fear. each time my finger is in pain or even get a tingling sensation, my mind instantly jumps to that conclusion. i almost dont care about anything else. i have stomach pains and im going to see a gastroenterologist about it, i really wouldnt care if they told me i had cancer. rabies is just something that truly sparks fear in my mind. i even freak out seeing bats in the sky since i work at stadiums as a camera guy.",Anxiety

24821,"following is a boring and overwhelmingly long whining of a nonnative english speaker. those who are interested in taking a quick peek at the life of a young man in russia are welcome. my post might seem pale in comparison to other ones, and my problems are made up, and i myself might seem an attention craving internet vampire. i wrote it mainly because of therapeutic reasons i wanted to structure and order my thoughts about the current situation i am in. hello. i am almost 24yo, and my mental issues seem to be getting more severe every month. i am stuck in an adverse situation of uncertainty and see no hope to get out of it. i am a permanent resident of russian federation. i came over as a student from the central asian outskirts of the former soviet union where we had to remain after its dissolution. i left it when i was 17yo the rest of my family still remains there, and i could not wait until i am an adult to try to get my first parttime software developer job. thanks to being an introverted loner at my school time, at the time of my 18th birthday i had my head crammed with fundamental computer science knowledge, so i got my first job relatively easily. to be frank i had no particular need to support myself while being a student my parents would have supported me even if i had not got a job, but i was eager to separate from them, to slip from their parental guidance as soon as possible. but in the last semester the tension started to increase, and i was under a constant strain i had to work keeping a decent performance while doing my bachelor's graduation work. also that was the time i first encountered difficulties with my shaky migration status i would have had to leave the country right after graduation if i had not acquired permanent resident status or been enrolled at a postbachelor programme.i started to delve into russian migration laws only to find out that i have literally no legal grounds to acquire a permanent residency, and any violation of the law may end up in being barred from entering the country. imagine being thrown out back to the country where you have literally nothing left no perspectives, no job, no money but with an inevitable perspective of being put into the ethnically unfriendly environment due to the conscription into the mandatory army service for the record slavsgermans and a couple of other ethnicities are literally minorities in postsoviet central asian states. all of that made me extremely anxious and depressed, and one day i finally snapped i got a nervous breakdown. i was diagnosed with mixed anxietydepressive disorder and was prescribed a yearlong medication course xanax and escitalopram. i managed to join the master course of my university thus deferring the end of my stay for two years. but the russian migration laws started to change right on the cue, and i got an opportunity to acquire a permanent residence by proving that i am a competent user of russian language and bound to russian culture. i pulled it off, got my residence permit, dropped the master course and started to live relatively quietly thanks to antidepressants. now i am at the crossroads. i have an opportunity to become a russian citizen, but here we go again i am again a subject for a mandatory oneyear military service til i am 27yo. i am far from being called a pacifist you have to be cruel to be kind, you know, but it is utterly repugnant to me, especially the fascist militaristic rhetoric the proponents of mandatory service use to justify its presence in contemporary russia. one might call me a freeloader, an inconsiderate citizen evading his duties, but i can object the mandatory military service in russia has nothing to do with protecting your country or preparing you to be a good soldier should the situation require it. it is just a kind of tradition serving the demand from the society for being citizens of a strong and prominent country and a way for army generals to get some slush funds. most of the real responsibilities are transferred to military professionals on the payroll, while from the perspective of a conscript it looks like serving an obligatory jail term, which might be a sentence to my professional and social life, and also to my mental health. i have three ways to dodge the draft barring the illegal ones1 keep going as a noncitizen permanent resident until i am 27. there are too many risks here you have to adhere strictly to the migration laws, every second fine for the last three years may lead to prohibition on entry and residence withdrawal. migration laws are overwhelmingly messy and full of dark corners, which makes me persistently anxious although i am a very lawabiding immigrant. also it is undesirable to leave the country for more than six month during the year since it leads to residence permit cancellation too.2 being exempted from the draft by proving i have an ailment incompatible with military service. most of the relatively lightweight diagnoses including mixed anxiousdepressive disorder meet these requirements. a relatively straightforward way but the only thing is that the conscription system is crooked. your local draft board staff is apt to deceive you about your rights as a conscript, preventing you from exercising your rights in order to fulfill an anticipated conscription plan. one has to doublecheck everything they say or do to you and file complaints if something deviates from the law. even if your diagnosis was given to you by an authorized doctor, you will be committed for a comprehensive to a psych ward where you will have to languish for two or three weeks. if the diagnosis is approved, you will have to pass a couple or two of medical examinations before being exempted. almost all people sometimes even psychiatrists you have to deal with are biased and suspect you of feigning your disorder in order to dodge the draft. it requires too much moral strength to stick it out. i am not certain i can stand it up well even being on antidepressants. these adverse tendencies are only magnified it is harder to fulfill conscription plans due to the pandemic.3 to leave the country in favor of europecanadaaustralia, never to come back. i wanted to migrate to canada for a long time since my childhood, maybe, but now i think it is completely impossible. i never thought much of my value as a professional, but now it seems completely negligible. i am strenuously trying to become a better professional every day, but i am only affirming my opinion about myself. this adds to my anxiety and depression too, since doing a good job might be the only source of my satisfaction with myself. no one would hire me to relocate somewhere. even if someone would, i do not like the idea of burning my bridges to russia. i am not certain i can accommodate well, and might have to return back. doing so without citizenship would be an ordeal.so, now i am feeling completely empty. it seems i slipped into a depression again was i out of it at all, and keep going because i have been ruminating on everything i wrote here for a half of a year. my thoughts are sluggish, my concentration is fucked up. i see no hope in my future, but i am also unable to kill myself. i feel like half of my life is past me, and the other part is joyless too. i feel like i am dying

if you never enjoyed school or college which i didn't then why did you actively decide to go to university? hmm. maybe because i thought i had to not because i wanted to pursue a career i have absolutely no ambition at all. and it was partly because the idea of getting a job after i left college at 18 seemed completely impossible i've suffered from social anxiety for most of my life the basics of social interaction are overwhelming to me. but mostly, it was because i didn't think any of it through. i didn't want to think it through at all. my parents thought i could maybe go to this university, so i just said okay. i didn't even look into the university at all, and i didn't consider any others. the reason that i do this is because i hate thinking about the future short, medium and long term. whenever people ask me about the future, whether its where do you see yourself in five years, what do you want to do with your life or even simply do you have any plans for the weekend, ive always given vague nonanswers. i've been like this forever. probably because ive been bombarded with these questions from career advisors since year 1. but it's also because the future is too uncertain and complicated. it scares me to think about the future in any sort of way. so i don't. and now i'm paying the price. and the future gets closer every day. and i wish i could go back in time, maybe to live things differently, maybe to live them the same. i think about the past my childhood especially every day. and every single night i dream about the past too. the other day i had one about the last day of year 11. ive had hundreds like it, all about the last day of secondary school. the thing that haunts me about it is the fact that i dont remember what happened. all i remember is that i never saw any of my peers again after that day. because i made the conscious decision to leave them, and go to a different college. every single dream i have involves my old school friends. every one. in case it isn't clear, my recent doubts over starting let alone completing, or succeeding with my dissertation are related to so many other things that i have consciously, often deliberately bottled up over the years and it is years. i know how unhealthy and dangerous it is to do this, but i do it anyway because it's easier, and because it's been the default way of accepting, contemplating and processing my emotions for as long as i can remember. i've never had the desire to tell anyone including family about my most vulnerable thoughts and feelings, fears and insecurities, becausewellwhere to start? fear of judgement, fear of being misunderstood, fear of being understood, fear of the literal and emotional consequences on myself and on my relationships the fact that emotions were and are are never discussed in my family, or in the few social circles i used to have note haven't had friends for five years. i bottle all of this up. and i'll continue to. but it feels like the bottle is starting to overflow. if anyone has read this far, you might as well consider yourself the first person who has ever heard anything that is even remotely as private as what i've just revealed in these last few paragraphs. and if you've read this far and if you are a healthy, normal person you will have obviously thought to yourself, yeah, he needs therapy. but i don't think i do, and i certainly don't want to. theres a small part of me that desires to let it all out i could write a book about all of my problems, but i know that would be a terrifying and draining experience, even if it leads to something better. and the desire certainly isn't big enough for me to have serious thoughts about seeking helpfrom anyone in fact. i think thats the bottomline regardless of whether i need help, or guidance, or advice, or support, or sympathy, i don't think i want it. not enough, anyway. i think id hate myself for seeking it out because i'd feel like a desperately sad narcissist. i know i'm pathetic, dumb, probably annoying, an embarrassment, a failure, a waste of space, time, money and effort, but i dont think i'm a narcissist. and i know that people who seek help aren't narcissistic, but i would think that i am if i did. so i don't. and i've never sought help from anyone. not only the serious, personal stuff, but the little, trivial, specific things too. is it because of a deeprooted social anxiety, and my complete lack of social confidence, ability and experience? yes. but like with my other anxieties that i probably need help with health anxiety, fear of the future, fear of the passage of time, the fear of failure, the fear of work, the fear of my dissertation i don't care about help, or support, or selfimprovement. i dont want any of it because i think it wont work for me, or that it doesn't apply to me. i dont want to be helped. and yet here i am writing this.",Anxiety

i know that sounds cheesy, but for real, when and how will i find my inner selfunderstanding. i look at like with different mindsets, and they switch up every day or week without my notice. i just recently got a screen for depression, and for one i did not answer some of the questions honestly because i was too nervous too. but also these questions were driving me crazy, i could not tell how to answer any of them. if i answered them a second time the day after, i would have given different answers. that day i walked out of the doctor's office feeling selfcritical and angry about this. i wonder if my mindsets change too much. maybe my personality is too malleable? i understand that people change, but my view of how i view myself and the environment around me changes a bit drastically sometimes.i obsess over dumb shit. waist too much time revisiting and spending extended periods of time pondering on them. lately, i have been very concerned by the possible idea that i may be bipolar or something. i feel so stupid for even typing that out, but that is the truth as to how i have been thinking. i probably am not, and i just overthink everything. but it roots from my desperate want to understand my emotions. recently, i had a day i do not remember why where i felt very very very low and sad. i have not had this feeling in a long time. i physically felt slow. i mentally felt unable to comprehend the external environment. i felt too lost in my head. the world around me shut off, but i was still going on autopilot. i was so sad, i felt numb. this was a buildup to this low from the past couple of days before. i was having some really dark thoughts i do not want to talk about. but the next day i felt so up, to the point i had a euphoric feeling in my body for part of it. now i feel like i am starting to level out again. that day admittedly, i had a really fun day doing activities, so maybe it was that. but what throws me off is how i went from so so low like you have to take my work for it to so so. high.i could go on more and more, but my fingers would fall off from the typing, and i am starting to get tired. i hope this post stays up. i guess all i am asking for is someone to listen. even if you do not respond to this, thank you for taking the time to hear my rambling. i am sorry if this feels like a shit post, i do not expect everyone reading this to understand or relate, i just do not know how else to convey my accumulating thoughts. i want to just unplug the drain a bit somewhere and for now, this feels like it helps a bit. venting is great. a drain that i never feel i have the time to unplug.",Depression

25119,"i have always been depressed but only once it entered a stage where it was like a deep, dark sickness. i could not eat or sleep properly for weeks. constantly throwing up, crying and enduring mental trauma just kicking and tossing on the bed unable to cope with the pain. i grabbed my combat knife and started slicing my arm, starting at the wrists. i cut as hard and as fast as i can, even a few times making a sawing motion with the knife on my wrist. the knife simply was not sharp enough to cut deep enough into my veins. i was dripping blood all on my clothing and bedroom floor. i got so frustrated and angry i could not kill myself then and there, i just blindly started cutting my arm all over in a fury just begging god to let me die, chanting die in tears. i ended up willingly getting admitted into a psych ward after the police was called by my mother.there is such a large amount of things that make me depressed but what took it to this extreme level was this girl. years before i ever even saw her, i had this ideal in my head of the absolute most perfect girl that never existed and she matched it perfectly. down from how she wears her hair, her accent, voice tone, nationality, dressing style, ethnicity, personality, mannerisms, sense of humor, body type, skin complexion, intelligence, height, talents, hobbies, etc i never met nor witnessed a girl that came anywhere close to her in real life nor the internet. i always thought this type of girl my heart desired did not exist, only in fiction. i was so struck, i instantly became in love and admittedly obsessed. she is like an angel, such mesmeric beauty i become entranced. slowly, without her my world became dull. i lost interest in my hobbies, stopped desiring my dreams and wishes, grew distant with my friends and family even more so than before. it became nearly impossible to get out of bed and i neglected myself, destroying my self image even more. i lost all my confidence in pursuit of her love. needing her affection and presence more than my mind instinctively desiring food and water, fate has tested this many times.the only thing i care about is her, she is all my heart desires. i rather be poor, starving, homeless and dying of thirst as long as i have her in my life. i lost so much weight in my pursuit of happiness along with other body and mind transformations. no matter what, it seems i am not attractive enough for anyone. not good enough, not man enough. this fate is worse than any death. years went by where i got better the depression and anxiety was still cripplingly bad but now its coming back, again.i convinced myself i will transform to a man no women cannot resist, only then will i have a proper shot to her heart. multiple years passed, i am now 24, my birthday was july 5th and i am still just terrible. my body shape is still goofy and unmanly, i am poor and i still do not have the confidence to even be myself in front of people. i am slowly starting to feel that familiar sickness growing in my mind and body. if this gets as bad as before, i do not think i will survive this time. i am becoming desperate to die again",Depression

48887,"daily habits for a less stressful life everyone wants less stress. and that is why in this post i will talk about daily habits for a less stressful life. i myself apply these habits every day in my life. so everything i talk about comes from my own experience. once you apply the methods in this post regularly they will eventually become habits. at first it may be difficult to apply these methods because it may all feel a little strange. but once you experience the positive effects you will find enough motivation to continue. why you need to create daily habits for a less stressful life most people do a lot in a day. and that can be incredibly wonderful, but it can also cause a lot of stress. and stress is not always bad for you. it can sometimes help you get the best out of yourself. but longterm stress can be very bad for your health. for example, it can cause your immune system to deteriorate, making you more likely to get sick. but it can also cause you to become irritable and your mood to deteriorate. ultimately, it can also cause you to have almost no energy or motivation left to do things. in addition to the aforementioned consequences of longterm stress, there are many more consequences that you dont want to have either. and to reduce the risk of these consequences it can be helpful to create habits for a less stressful life. focus on your breathing for a less stressful life sometimes people get a lot of stress because they get lost in thoughts. to prevent you from overthinking and getting stressed, it is useful to sometimes focus on your breathing. for example, if you are busy working or studying, remind yourself to focus on your breathing once every 10 minutes. you dont have to breathe differently! just let your breathing flow naturally but focus on it for a moment. feel the air go in and out. meditation is one of the daily habits for a less stressful life meditation can help you unwind completely. you can meditate by sitting down and focusing on your breathing. as guidance you can say to yourself in when you inhale and out when you exhale. then as your breathing gets deeper and slower you can say deep and slow to yourself. make a daily habit of going outside for a less stressful life. the environment you are in can affect how much stress you experience. suppose you are in an environment where you are constantly receiving signals that cause stress. such as phone calls, emails, or other things that remind you of stressful situations. then it can be useful to get away from this situation for a while. and preferably it can be useful to go to a park, forest, lake or sea. because in these environments there is often a lot of space and there are few or no things that cause stress. walk mindfully and when youre walking, pay attention to your footsteps and your breathing. inhale and take, for example, three steps. and then when you exhale, take another three steps. also feel how your feet touch the ground. this mindful way of walking gets you out of your head and into the moment. go exercise and feel the stress disappear being physically active is incredibly important. but its also incredibly helpful to exercise if you want to release stress. i myself really feel the stress disappear when i exercise. and if ive trained really hard im sometimes so tired that i dont even feel like stressing about anything anymore haha. you dont necessarily have to train super hard. the stress can also disappear during an easy workout. or go for a jog while listening to your favorite music and feel the stress disappear. help your friends and family i wish you much success in applying these methods for a less stressful life. hopefully you can apply them so often that they become habits in your daily life. but i do want to ask you one more thing. i suspect that you have friends and family who also sometimes suffer from longterm stress. you can help these friends and family by sending them this post. and maybe you can start creating these habits together which will make it a lot easier for both of you. because working together on something ensures that you motivate each other. originally from this blog post",Stress

25147,"as of the time i am writing this, its 146 am, july 7th, the day before my birthday. in the last couple months, i have had alot to endure. alot of death, internal struggles, physical problems and more and i have forced myself to endure it all because i do not want to stay weak. however, the more i think about my past, the more i think about events that should have been critical in my life, the more i realise it. i am not weak, i am just. pathetic. as much as i want to blame toxic masculinity for things like mostly being unable to cry not kidding, i rarely cry with tears because i literally cannot produce them as much as i would like, trying to stay tough and more, it is dawned on me that i am simply pathetic. i shut myself off from the world, from people and blame others for things i have failed at while i know damn well it is my own fault. i have refused to let people in not because of fear i would get hurt, but either because i plainly did not care, because i refused to accept them into my life or because i was too busy with my own bullshit and simply wanted to go home and lay in bed doing nothing. its why the memory of my grandfather, almost weeping because of pain and speaking to my family haunts me. while he was in more pain i could imagine, i was on my phone waiting to go home. i have reached nothing in my life, and as much as i say my life is simply not interesting, i have never tried to make it interesting. i have always been too busy taking care of my own menial problems and saying i am too busy for anything, and when i do start something new, 9 times out of 10 i quit it because i just do not give enough of a fuck to see it through. though i am still young, many of my peers have already had much more succes than me. be it in a financial way, a romantic way, a social way, everyone i know has exceeded me. even the ones who i never thought would do so well blew me by, leaving me in the dust. the funny part is. i deserve it. i have always been a piece of shit. mentally fragile, egotistical, greedy, selfish, jealous, sadistic, easily angered and more. its resulted in me being an empty she will of a human being, always exhausted, always in pain and unworthy of being alive. i have tried to compensate for the horrible person i used to be, but by doing that i have almost completely stopped caring for and about myself, and though today i heard my boss say he admired that i put others before myself, i know who i used to be. and, as much as i try to compensate and grow. i know best what i truly am pathetic. my body can often barely keep up, i am emotionally, mentally and physically drained, i am incredibly depressed, always feel sick, i am lazy, always try to get others to do shit for me, i am envious and so much more, but most of all, i am empty.i do not care of i get hurt, i do not care if i am healthy, i do not care if i wake up in the morning, i do not care for shit. call me out in the comments all you want, insult me or whatever, i do not care anymore. i know how horrible of a human being i am, and i know i am not worth your time or anyones time for that matter. i am sorry for wasting your time, but for what it is worth, thanks for reading this. the sudden realisation i am pathetic.",Depression

15265,"tw mentions of sexual assaultampx200bthis year in february i was sexually assaulted on a school field trip. it was from a guy who was in one of the other classes but he was still in my grade. he picked me up and put his hands in places that made me very uncomfortable. i yelled at the guy to stop and he did but it still made me uncomfortable.a few months later i decided to come forward and talk to a teacher from my school about it in hope that she would help or at least do something. one of my close friends came with me to talk to the teacher as i did not feel strong enough to talk to her alone. my friend and i talked to the teacher, let us call her mrs. x, and at first, mrs. x seemed understanding and supportive. later that day mrs. x pulled me and my friend out of class to write down a few things to back up my allegations. i made a witnesses list as other people had witnessed my being assaulted. this was followed by my witnesses being interviewed and giving details.on my final period on a friday, i was pulled out of my class and mrs. x pulled me into an empty classroom and sat me down. for the next hour, she ran me through about how i was lying and that one of the witnesses had told her that i was lying and just did not like the guy who assaulted me and i was doing it all for a laugh. as anyone would, i sat in that classroom and cried. mrs. x believed one witness and not the victim. then came the scariest thing i had heard, you will likely be charged with false reporting of sexual assault and will have a permanent criminal record. now i am a good person i have never got a detention or anything but i would not say i am the teacher's pet but still, of all the things that i thought could have come from me coming forward this was not one of them. ampx200bi spent the whole weekend in fear. i could not afford to have a criminal record. i had not even told my parents about it. i was so angry at my school for doing this to me. i know that i was sexually assaulted and i would never ever make things like that up. i was furious but also very scared of what would happen next. i heard nothing about the situation till the next tuesday, two weeks after i came forward. mrs. x pulled me out of class again and into her office. she told me that the guy's family did not want to give me a criminal record or charge me. then she looked me in the eye and said that i was a lair and that i was overreacting.ampx200boverall, mrs. x still does not believe that i was assaulted. and i am thankful that the guy's parents were nice enough to not send my life into a downward spiral. i got in trouble for being sexually insulted",Depression

35179,"a story about my anxiety in the recent past, and issues i'm facing today a little long as my title says, i've been having an intense battle with anxiety lately. i have anxiety and depression that i was treating with zoloft until the end of last february. i am a 21 year old male that lives in the midwest. 1. last year around midjune of last year, i had started to get some insomnia the kind that wakes you up early, which i then blamed on the fact that my basement room is incomplete and family upstairs made a lot of noise. i also had brain fog, with all the complications that accompany it, which i had blamed on my lack of sleep. it sucked, but i decided i should wait for my mind to improve on their own. during this time, i had a slight, but long lasting, bit of anxiety about something unrelated. during this time, i decided to drink 30ml of zzzquil before bed in order to help me go to sleep quicker, and i would sometimes take a sip of it if i had woken up too early. 2. a few months ago i lived with everything until middecember, in which i started to have pain in my testicles and prostate, as well as my upper back and in random parts of my body. long story short, i started to get intense anxiety about possible cancer. in order to slightly control it, i stopped drinking coffee every day and quit smoking weed once a week. eventually, i had an ultrasound and a ct scan done, which found nothing. the symptoms associated with my lower region faded a couple of days after. at some point along the way, i started having more symptoms, such as forgetfulness, possible confusion, numbness and tingling in my hands and feet, a feeling of dizziness or vertigo, a slight shaky feeling in my upper left arm, and what i can only describe as brain zaps. i also felt like my memory was getting a lot worse. these symptoms seemed to persist even on days when the anxiety seemed less bad. i made the mistake of googling my symptoms and good old brain cancer showed up. i pushed my doctor to give me an mri, which later turned up nothing. 3. a few days ago over the time after i got the mri results back, the anxiety seemed to come down from a constant 58 to a 23 on a scale from 010, and while a couple of symptoms seemed to disappear over the next week and a half, i started to get new ones, such as random twitches and fasciculations in random, varying parts of my body which i blamed on drinking coffee again and trouble going to sleepgetting woken up in the middle of the night which i blamed on weaning myself off of the zzzquil i had mentioned before. when i started to go to sleep or wake up, i would also have thoughts that would make no sense. i still have these symptoms today, which is my motivation for writing this post. i confess i still worried about things like spinal cancer and whether or not anything was actually wrong with me aside from the anxiety, so i made the same mistake of googling again last wednesday. this time, i came across brain prion diseases, specifically vcjd, which threw me in to another state of panic and anxiety, possibly even greater than the last couple. 4. today and the future this time, i'm worried that it might be the real deal, despite the hilariously low odds i have of actually having it. the worst part is, rationally i know i probably don't have what i'm so scared of. luckily i had a doctor's appointment the next day after my latest googling mistake, and they set me up with a sort of behavioral counselor, as well as having me start on a different antidepressant. i guess what i'm seeking by writing this post is reassurance that i won't be a clinically insane mess of a human due to some brain issue in 6 months. i'm constantly auditing my environment, past experiences, and my own thoughts in order to make sure i'm not hallucinating or something like when i woke up around a week ago in the middle of the night to the smell of something burning, which could have just been my heater i just feel skeptical sometimes that all of the symptoms i'm feeling or have felt can be due to solely anxiety, when it's never been this bad before. the past few months have made me mentally tired, due to having to put up with the stress of daily life in addition to everything above. the insomnia and the anxiety have definitely taken a toll on me. i just hope it actually is just anxiety and nothing serious.",Anxiety

17337,"so, a bit about me i am a 21 year old guy. grew up in a family that strongly believes in academics to be the most important thing in life. consequently, i had no lack of support from them for my studies, rather, saying i want to study was a common excuse for me to not do my chores. while i say excuse, i loved to study. we did not have internet or television, so most of what i read was textbooks provided by our school, and sometimes novels i took out of the school library. my school grades were top notch. the school itself was highly competitive, but when i graduated from high school, i had the fifth highest score in the school. pretty good, everyone expects me to do well. i also did well in some entrance exams and got into a top university, studying compsci.but that is where the happiness stops. the university is terrible at teaching, and that demotivated me from studying the subjects all by myself. the result? terrible. my grades dropped. but still, they were not that terrible in my first year. i had a fail grade in one subject which i cleared. but then, that one fail grade completely demotivated me. i stopped paying attention to classes, and eventually stopped going to them. my friends and some of the better professors would ask me what is wrong, and i would do my best to avoid them. eventually, i was scared to even go out lest i will meet some of my classmates or teachers. and the result was obvious, i failed all the classes that semester.now, i was too scared to tell this to my family. they were bad enough when i had one failed subject last time, and warned me that i will be not allowed to continue studying and waste their money if i just wanted to fail. so i showed a fake grade sheet. and yes, they want to see the grade sheet or they will not pay for the next semester. i thought i would maybe clear those subjects one by one and they would not know. but now the shame of missing most of the classes in the last semester caught up, and i realised i could not concentrate in the classes at all. no one would talk to me voluntarily, and they would just answer very short when i ask something, and sometimes will not even do that. so eventually, that semester got fucked too.and this happened the next time too. i failed most of the subjects and had to fake my grades. but the university had terminated me, and i had to appeal for them to reinstate me. they did, and i had to retake the previous years subjects. but i did not know anyone from the class, and again, could not concentrate. i had planned to kill myself in the end of summer semester 2020, but because of the pandemic, we had to go back home. back home, i pretended to be attending lectures while doing something else on my laptop. the last year i attended exactly 0 classes.of course, my family thinks i am studying, but i am not. remember i said i loved to read? now i cannot even fucking concentration on reading something. every night when i sleep, i promise myself that i will start studying tomorrow, but that never happens. the moment i open my textbook or some website to study, i lose all motivation. i cannot do it.today was supposed to be the day i graduate and receive my degree. my family does not know. and they are one phone call away from knowing. we are not too rich, we cannot afford a regular psychiatrist. and anyway, i will be the one blamed, because that is how it has always been here. if i score low in a paper, it is because i did not study enough, not because i had a fever. i had a fever because i am too lazy to study. what do you think i will get when i say i have been failing for three years, i have just been faking my grades? i do not even have enough skills to find a job, and no one wants to hire a student who failed three years and could not get help for himself. and academics was the only thing i was ever good at.frankly, every night i pray that i will not wake up alive. i do not have the guts to slice my wrist or stab myself in the heart or hang myself or something else. i have came close to completing those things, but i just cannot do it. i have ruined my life, and i hate myself.",Depression

34369,"heart anxiety for no reason hello all, first post on here, there's some really good advice from people in here so hopefully someone will have been through something similar to me. i just wondered if anyone else has the same thing as me. i am anxious about having a heart issue, every day, and this doesn't seem to be based on anything at all. there's no family history, i'm relatively young 32, have had all the heart checks available with nothing being found, my cholesterol is fine, and i can do mild exercise with no pain i'm pretty unfit and just started doing exercise so i'm at a mild level. i threw away my blood pressure monitor because i think it was feeding my anxiety but when i used to take it, it was always in the normal range. but every day, i'll feel my heart beating in my chest at random times. sometimes when i'm lying on my side, and in certain positions on the sofa. sometimes i'll feel a strange vibration feeling in my chest. or i'll feel my heart beat normally, then seem to stop, then thump back into rhythm. my partner will put her ear to my chest and tells me it's beating normally but to me, it feels like it's thumping and missing beats. when i get any of those sensations, i'll worry about what it means and i'll feel panicky, especially if i'm on my own, or in a situation that i can't escape from, such as a plane or recently, on the london eye ferris wheel. maybe it's the thought of help not being easily available to get to me. the current snow in england is making me a little panicky that help won't get to me. along with those weird heart sensations, i'll get chest discomfort, like a heavy indigestion feeling, sometimes odd feelings in my arm, sometimes light headed feelings. none of it is painful, it's just like weird sensations. i've attempted to put my chest sensations down to digestive issues such as acid reflux and i've tried eating better and exercising to improve my health but so far, it hasn't made much difference. i don't know if there is something going on that no one can find or whether i'm literally doing it all to myself. i'm not an anxious person normally. i can talk in public, i'm not socially anxious at all, it seems to be this one and only issue and i've no idea where it came from. does anyone else get these feelings, and if so, how do you ignore them and how have you managed to reduce them?",Anxiety

randomly became friends with a boy from our school, after online classes started. we suddenly got close and were known as a trio and the boy started liking my best friend. he confessed to her after some days, only to get rejected by her since she already had a boyfriend. that pissed him off, and they had a fight and blocked each other everywhere. i was asked to do the same.after some months, in my mathematics class he texts me saying that he wants to be friends with me again, and i unblock him. we became quite close, and somewhere he had begun calling him my best friend. it is not like i minded it, so i went with it. he started going out with a girl during this time, whom he said that he liked a lot, but i knew that he only wanted a girl. this pissed me off a bit, but i did not say anything. we were quite good friends during this time, but the way he treated the girl annoyed me a lot. he went as far as asking another girl for ndes while he was with her, and when asked, he termed it as a joke. despite all this, i was still friends with him.the last straw of their relationship was when the boy forced himself on the girl inspite of her asking him to stop many times. that was it, i was ready to break my friendship with him. i cared about the girl, and i could not be friends with someone like him.this is where the entire problem began.i wrote him messages, saying that i wanted to end our friendship, and i think it was during this period when i started getting manipulated by him. he kept nagging me for forgiveness, and convinced me that he was the victim in that situation and that it was not intentional. i knew that this was wrong, but i think it softened my view for him, a bit. i wanted to hate him, but it was practically impossible for me to do so. so i started talking sht about him in group chats and calls where he was not present, so that my friends would think i hate him.somewhere during all this, he was again my self proclaimed best friend, and along the line i lost many friends too, which made him the only support i received in my life. when all my classmates talked sht about me, he was my support. or so i thought. i tried getting rid of him from everywhere. blocked him, ignored him, everything. but somehow he still contacts me and i have no idea how. he can go as far as calling my parents to tell them that i am ignoring them and tell them to ask me to unblock him. i hate him, very much, and i have tried countless times to push him out of my life but he keeps coming back. i even faked having a boyfriend, so that he leaves me, but he did not, and said that he would wait for me till i broke up with him. after all this, he keeps saying he loves me, did so for a long time and he is done a lot for me.along the line, i kept getting softened and manipulated by him, and mistook his obsessiveness and toxicity for love and affection towards me. i had a therapist but she kept asking me to focus on my studies and one time i tried opening up to her she shut me up saying this is all just superficial sht. somewhere along, i started taking anti depressants, which were of no use since they make me feel numb and devoid of feelings. i cannot talk about this with my parents either, since they love him and think that he is a really good guy. and when i try to talk to them, they ask me to take anti depressants and that they are busy for my bullshit.to be honest, i am a very impulsive person. i do everything out of impulse. i cut my lower back length hair short because of impulse. and then i regret everything. my last straw was a similar decision. he said he loved me one day, and with all my tangled feelings of love and hate towards him, i agreed upon dating him. a decision i deeply regret, since it was really my last straw. it was suffocating for me and i just wanted to run away from everything. but i could not break up because that would mean me losing the support of my classmates all together, since he had already manipulated all of them into thinking that he loves me a lot, they would think i am toying with my feelings. i could not do that anymore, so i broke up with him, with my best friend's support. i thought i would finally get rid of him, but he created a lot of drama saying that i toyed with his feelings and everything. and all my classmates called me all sorts of things because of that. he somehow even managed to befriend my best friend too.i am just done with all this. i have run away countless times from home, but i always end up coming back because i have nowhere to go. recently, i overdosed on anti depressant pills, and currently i am in the hospital. i really thought i would die, but i did not. i do not know what to do, and how to get him out of my life. i am going to get into a college soon, and i just cannot focus on my academics or myself because of all this. i have studied my entire life to become a doctor from this college of my dreams, but now i just want all this to

11537,"the title is not meant to discourage others, but it is what i feel things have come to in my personal experience with life. i just want to get some stuff of my chest, even though it will not help for long. what better place to do it than reddit? i do not know, but i will still do it. i do not expect anyone to say the magic words that help, so this is again more for me to unload. however there is a possibility someone can help so it does not hurt. i also rarely write large amounts of texts like this, so i am sorry for the confusion you might get from the out of order randomness etc. from this text.this is also going to be really long, as i will include many things both as background and as reason.if you struggle with things yourself, please do not take my text as a sign to be discouraged. i feel terrible when i see others struggle and i wish i could help them. let us start with a little about memy first name is adrian the rest will remain anon. i am just about to turn 24 years old, live in norway and have a stable full time job. i have an apartment, a car and money is not an issue.when most people hear that, they think i have life perfectly under control that i am more lucky than others. and to a degree that is true. i have been more lucky than many people in this world but it is not what i have in my possession that brings me happiness. what brings me down is my social anxiety combined with depression. i have a somewhat different type of social anxiety, but i was still diagnosed with it. i can be in crowds, be it in malls or shopping centers stores whatever it might be without an issue. talking to strangers is not an issue, unless it is random chatting. by that i mean, if i am to pay for what i am buying and have do exchange a few words with the clerk in order to get something from the medical cabinet or something similar i have no issues at all. i think that is because i know what to say, how to respond and all that it is all been done before enough times where i am comfortable doing it. when it comes to random chat however. it is tough to even do with my family. primarily because i have nothing to talk about. when i am at work, and my colleagues are having a chat i never join in because i have no clue how to participate. even the colleague who is just 1 year older than me seems to have done a million more things and therefor have a lot more to talk about. while i sit there, trying to think of something interesting i can mention but i am completely blank. when i do however get asked about something i do know, it is quite alright until i make some sort of mistake like stating a fact, that turned out to be false i feel like an idiot. i do not show that though i shrug it off and pretend i found it sort of funny. i live most of my life currently pretending i am happy, like everything is fine. i work at a place i cannot show my depression to others. i imagine most places would be like that however. i am quite good at that now, do not think most people know my life is. bad. let us go back in time a bitquite early in my life, after changing schools because of moving i was starting to become a target from bullies. the good old classic. some people would constantly pick on me, other people pretended to be disgusted when i was nearby some just ignored me and so on. the school's solution to this was to remove me from class. i thought back then that was great, get me away from those people. i have however come to realize that it was probably a bad solution. i never got to work with other students, never really had a chance to socialize the little bit you can during class. i was alone, with a teacher of my own. i did have a few friends, so that was something but long story short i messed that up and lost them.this went on until the end of 10th grade. get bullied, picked on and have a few nice people that i would stick with until something happened that made them go away. then high school arrived and i was excited for a new chance with new people. and of course i liked the school. the first few months, i attended school but gained no contacts. no one treated me bad so i did not really mind that. until one day where i entered my classroom, 2 girls were standing by the door and laughed when i passed them. thinking back at it now, i think it was just a coincidence but back then it dropped my self esteem right back to the ground. 1 of those girls i even found attractive, so that did not help. then after a little more time things become quite good. i became friends with a few in class, and the rest still treated me quite alright. the only thing that made me feel bad was the thought i still had not had a girlfriend. this was at the age of 16, quite early to sob about such a thing. year 2 of high school, i went the route for car mechanics. i was back at the start of having no contacts, friends or such. i was still treated alright by everyone though. i asked some people if i could join them when they drove to the store to get lunch some were over 18 and they said i would be able to join them it one of the car seats were not taken by a spare wheel. i felt neutral about that, because at least they did not talk down on me or anything. later that year i made friends again. great right? indeed it was, school was fun again. fun fact, one of the people in this group was the girl i earlier stated i found attractive. the only relevant things from the rest of the year is about said girl. she was now a friend and i did not want to ruin that. so despise people saying she was interested in me i took no chances. so i treated her as a friend, until near christmas where i finally decided to somewhat casually ask her about going out and do something together. that was the day she just became the girlfriend of someone else in class. i was back at the bottom, but pretended to be happy. back then i was terrible at pretending and people kept asking why i was down. did not feel it was worth talking about so i walked away. she, and the others though did remain my friends out that year. school year ended, and people from that group started to become somewhat snappy passive aggressive. so i gave up on them too. i did however remain friends with said girls boyfriend. next year, i retake the same year but with another subject. same procedure, sit alone most of the time at first then i make 2 friends. we shared interest in gaming so we played online quite a bit. i believe these 2 were the best friends i had made. there is of course a girl in class i found attractive and she had a difficult personality to understand. i misunderstood her all the time and kept thinking she despised me. that of course did make me feel horrible a lot during that year. at this time, i do believe my main because of depression was things like this. the year ends, and i have to find a job but i fail. i think i got 1 singular interview during the summer. they did not want me there so i was without a job. here is where i got lucky, a company calls me and asks me to come in for an interview. i get there, and see the attractive girl from last school year was also called in for an interview. at this point i do however realize i am not despised and we had neutral opinions of each other. at least that is what i believe. both of us get the job as apprentices, so there is that. during the next 2 years nothing interesting happens, except me constantly feeling horrible about life and not having a single good experience on apps like tinder and so on. before i continue, let us fill out a bit how dating apps have hurt me. by the time i had reached 18, my depression was quite strong. i did honestly feel like people hated me but were nice and hid it. while using the apps, i was often unmatched within the first 5 seconds of matching. that did hurt when it had happened for the 20th time. i never dared to say hi to anyone so that is my fault i guess. those who said hi to me first made me feel good! for about 5 minutes until you could clearly tell in the messages they were uninterested. like the saying, talking to a wall.these apps, did bring me even further down overall. never up. back to the real life part. ampx200bafter 2 years you take sort of an exam, and after that you are no longer an apprentice. i scored maximum. 3 points, excellent. so did the girl i was working with. one of the people i worked with suggested i invited the girl out for a celebratory dinner for finishing school 100 with a good score. it was worth a shot. she denied that immediately. this did, once again destroy me inside, but in the long run it was for the better. both of us get's the opportunity to continue working for a partner company as long as the interview goes well. that it did. we both remained colleagues so that is when i realized it was indeed good she said no. about at this time though, i make a incredibly stupid decision to reset my social life. i thought if i could get myself into a completely new social environment i would maybe have a better life in general. i did this because i was still constantly feeling horrible like people disliked me and such. after this i never made new friends, and 3 soon 4 years later here i am still alone. i have never found another opportunity even to make new friends, i no longer meet new people. the people i meet at work are a lot older no offence to them. and those my age still seem to look down on me. that is the big thing with me, i feel like everyone looks down on me even without proof. the thing is, with social anxiety is one notices so many details of how one reacts to your presence. even to details that were never even there. i still am like this. quite a bit of people have given me suggestions on how to deal with things i have even tried talking to a psychologist. nothing worked. when people say good things to be it goes in one ear, and out the other. when people say rude things, it sticks like glue. i cannot take praises seriously anymore. i cannot take advices. i do not see the worth of anything. all in all, i really wish i never existed. i have done nothing good to this world. i have been destroyed i no longer want help. i just want it to be over. the only things that make me feel good, even just for a moment is random things like a stranger saying something nice. compliments from people i know, do nothing. i honestly think, the only thing that would get me out of this she will is a semirandom situation that for example results in me making a new acquaintance. but we all know that is not how the world works, especially for someone who is always at home when he is not at work. summary i do not think i can be helped anymore. my mind instantly switches anything positive to the negative. i was recently back at a neutral state, but then i had yet again a negative experience with another person which brought right back down to the floor. i feel worthless and all the other negative emotions one tend to feel during depression. this text became a complete mess, i know. there is even a ton of stories i wanted to fit in but it will just clutter it all up at this point. the results of my depression was, a couple years back i made a deal with myself.i will give life a chance to redeem itself. i have set a date in the future which i will not share but it is still several years until. if i still live alone, with no friends with no sense of purpose with no light in the tunnel i am in. i will take my leave. it did in a way help to unload this, but not as much as i had hoped because it did at the same time bring back couple bad memories of life. i do not really plan on paying attention to the comments here, but knowing myself i will probably still do it. i would also like to finally point out, that as mentioned partially in rule 5. most replies with long explanations that in short just tells you that just to this and it all works out will not work. i am a very complicated work of machinery not literally. for those who are just reading thanks for your time, and if you are struggling with something i do truly hope you figure it out. i know how it is. i just cannot figure out my issues. not everyone can be helped",Depression
9649,"when i was like 14 i was going through a hard time and getting suicidal thoughts like crazy, so i told my dad about it. his response was the classic suicide is selfish and then he proceeds to tell me i would get a straight ticket to hell if i killed myself because suicide is the ultimate sin so having learned all this, i decided to bear with life a bit longer hoping that life would get better. since then my dad became an alcoholic and my mom took off, leaving me and my autistic brother with him. i began struggling with my sexuality and started experiencing gender dysphoria, and over this past year i started cutting myself. i have never wanted to die more than ever. 3 times now, i have held a gun to my head but i was too chicken shit to pull the trigger because i do not want to experience an eternity of torment. i am not even sure if i belive that shit anymore. i am scared of death but at the same time i just want to escape. i feel trapped here, how am i supposed to cope with this world? there is nothing here for me. only reason i have not killed myself is because of religion",Suicidal

17143,"after a drought in therapy i went back to seeing a therapist and seeking help with antidepressants and antianxiety meds about a year and a half ago. my primary gave me a short list of recommended therapists and i was lucky enough to have gotten a call back from wendy. i had almost given up on her after waiting for a call back. but she called me back. we met just once in person in 2020 and then throughout covid it was all virtual once per week.my previous therapist had the philosophy that it was ok if i did not have a topic story issue something to talk about during our sessions and that it was fine to sit quietly and be comfortable with the silence. well, it was not with me. it was paying a copay to stare at one another uncomfortably but with wendy it was the opposite experience supportive, proactive, caring, understanding and she reached out to me as i am generally an introvert. she brought me from being completely disbelieving of her early prognosis of me being emotionally abused from a child to a young adult and experiencing the symptom of ptsd to where i am now that she was right all along. she was amazingly intuitive and i know that she was right. we were on the path to beginning emdr and beginning resourcing and starting to meet in person once we had both been fully vaccinated. things were moving along and once i had accepted the diagnosis of abuse and ptsd i was amazingly emotionally fragile and needy as all of my prior mental support systems and coping mechanisms as faulty and improper as they were had been erased. but she was there for me. all of the time. last week we had a tuesday meeting. all normal. we were to meet on thursday again that week. i walked in on thursday to find the lights in her waiting room turned off. odd, but not too strange, i turned them on and waited and waited and waited until twenty minutes past our appointment time. i texted her, called her straight to vm. and finally knocked on her door. locked. silent. for her to not respond was entirely unusual and i knew then that something was very, very wrong. i waited for an hour but no wendy.finally, i left. tried calling her that night. her inbox now was full and i knew that i was not the only one looking for her. it turned out that she had been reported as missing the day before. her car was found about an hour north of where she lived in a seasonal home's driveway. her last known cell activity was there but there was no sign of her until they found her body a few miles off shore a couple of days later.i was lost. i am lost. i will never know what exactly happened to her suicide, an accident or whether it was foul play because of death has not been released yet. but i cannot understand it. i do not know how to move on. i know that i need therapy again. i need to move from this temporary holding pattern that we had established preemdr but i feel enormously guilty about moving to a new therapist. it is like cheating on her. and besides the sheer enormity of starting from the beginning with someone new and gaining their trust and understanding. add to this the fact that very few innetwork therapists are accepting new patients right now probably due to postcovid stress. and it is touching all of my triggers being rejected, turned away, not wanted, etc.shit. sorry this is so long but i really needed to get this off my chest to an impartial audience that wendy would have fulfilled prior to now. any advice, kind words, anything would be welcome. lost my therapist, now what?",Depression

7610,"today was the first time i really thought about suicide. i have often thought through my life about death and imagined dying and have said things like i wish i was not alive to myself multiple times a day and have so for many years. but this was sort of a coping mechanism i think to deal with stress. i have been pretty successful in life, and probably happy by a lot of people's standards. in general i have been pretty driven and interested. i was clinically depressed about 15 years ago, but i have not had a similar episode since.however, today i felt a really different feeling when my usual thought came for the day. i did not just think i do not want to be alive, i thought maybe i will not be soon. i thought of some familiar fantasy of dying, but this this time it was real life. i thought about how i could enact that fantasy. then i wondered if that was really a realistic way to die. i do not want to die painfully. and i do not want to be resusitated and disabled by damage afterwards. so i spent the day researching suicide method outcomes and considering how nasty or available each one would be, all while pushing my two kids on the swings at the park and buying them some chocolate, making dinner, talking to my spouse, putting the kids to bed.i just cannot describe how strange it feels for these fantasies to have moved from this thing i did to cope with how stressed i was feeling to this other, oh i can do this feeling. it was so unexpected. it was just a normal day.i have never had these thoughts before, and i just wanted to write it down somewhere. i found this subreddit in the course of the day, and i have reddit so i thought it would be as good a place as any. july 28, 2021, maybe a new era in my life started today for reasons i cannot really understand.thanks for listening today was the first time i really thought about suicide",Suicidal

9504,"hello everyone,i rarely post on reddit but.i have nowhere else to go. i have talked to my selected friends but all your inputs are important. i would like to warn everyone this may have religious talks and depression.yeah.like that.i have a bestfriend of 20 years. this year she will be getting married to the love of her life. i am genuinely happy for her. i really am. here is the story my bestfriend got engaged last january 1. she is currently living in united kingdom, have a wonderful job and loving fiance. after the engagement, she told us and her closest friends and family that they will wed next year july of 2022. so i was really ecstatic of hearing such wonderful news, at last she will settle down and create a family of her own. she told me that she wants me and our other bestfriend to be there at her wedding, we are three. we have been bestfriends since high school. i got fired up to save a lot of money for plane ticket and pocket money to be with her on her special day. since i live in asia, and the cost when you go to uk will cost a lot since our salary here is like x10 lower than what people earn in the western countries.ampx200btil one time, she suddenly asked me if i could ask my uncle who is a priest if cohabitation is a sin. i asked her like why? she told me she and her fiance wants to live together, because living in separate houses traveling back and forth every weekend is very tiring for the both of them. i told her if they want to live together without tying the knot yet is not a big deal. if that will help save them gas and transportation allowance, then go. but she told me she is looking for answers and admitted they are in abstinence from sex for how many months now. she felt guilt doing premarital sex, and she always seeks answers from god. asking for signs and that. there is nothing wrong with that, i am a religious person myself but i do what i do. i know my limits. we have this saying in our country god have mercy on us, man has their doing. when i talked to my uncle who is a priest and asked him about cohabitation, he just straightly answered that cohabitation is a sin. and i told my bestfriend about it and she contemplated about it. and i know she is been asking a lot of people and even religious leaders in her country. and most of them told her there is nothing wrong if they want to live together. she is still reluctant. and fighting her anxieties over the matter. to the point that we raised our voice at each other during a video call, because she told me that my life become shitty because of karma, because i lived with my boyfriend for 1.5 years. it was a really big stab in my heart, and i cried but i dismiss what i felt and i still prioritize her because i know she is more vulnerable than i am. fast forward.i do not remember if when she did announce that they decided to wed this year. i was surprised and partly disappointed because the first thing that i thought was that i will never see her walking down the aisle in person, and partly i know the reason for the sudden shift. but it was only a short span of time because i understand that she wants to live in peace with the blessing of god. i just express how surprised i am, and i told her i am happy for her at last she will be settling with the man of her dreams.they will have a small wedding this year, and a big wedding next year which in the same month of july 2022.but as the months go on, she always asks me the same thing why do people have the same reaction, whenever i told them that we decided to marry this year. why cannot they be happy, they look dissapointed? why cannot they be happy for me? do not i deserve to be happy? i always answer her people will be surprised of course, because you told them that your wedding is next year and there is a sudden change but that does not mean that they are not happy. do not ever think that. i know it is her anxiety talking. i deeply understand, because i also have one i have had depression and anxiety for how many years. i always put myself in her shoes. ever our other bestfriend she always asks about it, and she just answers it is you and your fiance who will be getting married, not us, not other people. only the two of you will create your own happiness.i also answer the same thing everytime she asked about it. until i do not know what to say anymore, i asked my therapist and friends who got married about it. and they say tell her that it is only her that will create her own happiness, not everyone else. but we know anxiety is a big enemy.my bestfriend become so anxious as months passed by and at some point became bitchy. her patience shortened and at one point she is very angry? because the bishop is not responding through her email, and she even told me if within 2 weeks he does not reply that is it. she will find another one. i told her that she is not the only person who will get married, there is also plenty of couples who wants to wed. and because of pandemic the rules and schedules have changed, she has to understand it. and she was like is this what god wants?so after a few more weeks, she decided to transfer to another parish, and to her surprise there are schedules for weddings, the parish priest told her that he is available in 2 weeks time they could wed if they want to soon. and she was shocked at how fast it is. and i told her there ya go, no worries in finding a priest and you have a schedule. and she answered me it is too fast and too much.the priest asked them if they have a venue already? catering services? photographer? and others? and they plainly answer no, we do not have anything yet.the official schedule of her wedding is by september 18 this year. she became more anxious. i understand what they called wedding jitters. and she still ask me the same thing why do people have the same reaction, whenever i told them that we decided to marry this year. why cannot they be happy, they look disappointed? why cannot they be happy for me? do not i deserve to be happy? why is it like that?last friday we had that conversation again, and i told her do you want to know the truth? i can give you answers but you have to be ready. so, i told her that the possibility is that people see it as desperation, lack of security, insecurity, something like that. and i remind her that one time when one of her coworkers commented that is she afraid to lose her fiance something like that. and then the word desperation struck her. and she asked me is that also what you think of me and our other bestfriends name, is that it? and i plainly answered her no. and there is another question. were you disappointed when we announced that we are getting married this year? tell me the truth. i do not know what i was thinking that time but i told her the truth that i was a bit disappointed like 50 but it was for a short time. and i am passed by it. it was a very long time ago for me, and all i am focused on is i want her to walk down the aisle. and even volunteered to process her needed papers here in our country.she told me that she was very disappointed in me because she was not expecting that of me. so all this time i was not genuinely happy for her like all of it is fake. i told her it was not, i actually felt guilty that time, that is why i want to make it up to her by helping her with what i could give. she even asked me if our other bestfriend felt the same way and i told her it is not in my position to answer on her behalf. she told me on chat that her friend in uk was so genuinely happy when she asked her if she could be her bridesmaid. and she told me it is better for me to take care of things alone knowing that people are genuinely happy rather than people helping mewhich she is pertaining to me not genuinely happy. i want to justify myself more, but she just answered whatever. so i did not push any further, i decided that i just have to let her cooldown, i know she is very stressed out.ampx200bi contacted our other bestfriend and she called me and we talked a lot via messenger and during that time she is talking to our bestfriend in uk. she is a teacher here in our country and her patience is kind of running out, but we have to remind ourselves that it is her anxiety talking right now and we know she will not listen even to us. but my bestfriend kind of admitted to her that what i said about desperation kind of struck her, and somehow she thinks it is true. perhaps?i decided to mute all my chats in messenger because i need some time alone. and just played online games, talking to different people to shift my impending anxiety again of what has happened. i feel like i am terrible bestfriend for that. i am also dealing with a lot of shit in my life. but for me i have to prioritize her wellbeing. she needs me, and my other bestfriend more than ever. when i talked to my former boss turned male bestfriend i told him what happened, and what i like about his advice is that i am correct at some point but i should have told my bestfriend a white lie. even if she forced me to tell the truth about how i feel. she seeks positivity and assurance. and i am the only person and my other bestfriend who can give her assurance for that. i learned for that matter more.i am just worried about her, because she is snapping a lot. not just about the wedding but at her work as well. we told her to breathe. last time she got extremely mad at her fiance, because of a simple comment about the flowers. and she was like who will walk down the aisle? who is the bride? and our wedding is this year! not next year! and her fiance was so afraid whenever she gets mad. that he waited outside her apartment for them to be okay. but my bestfriend just ignored her. but they made up, do not worry. her fiance just wants to know, what is their plan? and she admitted that we really do not have one. i told her you two to have to sit down and talk. listen to what he says. you easily snap.at least they are okay now. and she found a beautiful wedding gown. which is really really beautiful. but i still do not read her last message because i am thinking i might have to justify myself. even my other bestfriend is also stressed out and worried that she always burst, she always explodes. she never cools down. i shared our predicament with my married friends and they told me wedding stress is normal, but not that much. because they balanced things out and talk about it as a couple. i understand my bestfriend wants acceptance. she wants a wedding where everyone is happy around her not just her. she wants to be like that.even we told her plenty of times that other people's opinion does not matter. what is important is that they love each other.but.she will still ask the same question.ampx200bi really do not know what to say. i feel like a bad person telling her how i felt before. i am sorry if this is kind of rollercoaster and long.i am just really worried. it is very hard to talk to someone with a closedmind right now. thank you for reading everyone. i feel like a bad person",Depression

47624,i'm different now and it hurts decided to use one of my many alt accounts and put it to work. my depression used to comes in waves and typically i could handle and channel it into art or music or something but recently this one i haven't been able to shake it and it's killed my productivity. i don't know really what set it off i never do. but in it i've realized alot about myself amongst other things which makes me feel worse. ill go through some but this ones a biggie. for context i was dating a girl for a while when it started i was like 15 and she was 18 going on 19 and she was allways emotionally abusive in some form but it all went down hill my junior year when i was 17 she started drinking more often and mixing her meds with it. long story short she ghosted for like 3 or 4 months and when she did contact me it was pretty much to say she's dumping me and moving to florida with a friend she met in college who i have on good report she was cheating on me with. i still haven't emotionally recovered from that mess every negative thing that happened to me has left me afraid of a repeat in my next relationship. since then my life got worse year after year and it's only just starting to stabilize again. one of those years though has left me blaming myself for getting my grandmother sick during covid leading to her death in 2021. there where other horrible events that lead me to here and now. on new year i decided to try to recapture how i use when i was 15. i was relatively happy i had confidence and drive to try to reach my dreams and personal goals and i had friends and people that loved me. but i cant all those aspects of me just don't last each time i mange to reclaim somepart of my former self something happens to destroy it and leave me worse off. in my attempt to reclaim something i've realized how far i've fallen behind people i considered friends and looked up to. they have great jobs they're chasing their dreams forming families surviving on their own going to college and are making something of themselves and i'm still in our home town working at the local casey's living in a spare room my stepfather and bio mother had no plans for. i'm not even sure they wanted me here they say they do but i know they didn't want a 20 year old moving inafter being kicked out. it's like no remnants of my former self exists if younger me could see me and realize how much i've changed for the worse he would beat me for wasting time and destroying what little attractiveness we had. i've always realized change was one of those things that are inevitable like death. i've always realized me from 6 years would be different from me now but i just always hoped it'd be for the better and not the worse possible thing to happen to me. the few people i've vented have always told me something about gods testing or he has a plan for me but fuck he must really despise me to make my grandfather who i lived with from 1 to 20 an abusive drunk who loved yelling screaming and threatening me every chance he got till he kicked me out the day after christmas put me in an abusive relationship let me get bullied horribly by almost everyone and take away one of the the few people i knew care for me and make her death be on my head. change is a constant and i've been changed so much that in just i few years that i'm permanently altered and the realization that i can't go back has hurt me far worse then any person can. sorry to subject you to my ramblings i remembered doing this used to help me and i was hoping it would again but it hasn't. sorry for the bothermr.e,Depression

like, being raised by my grandparents and not wanting to express some gratitude? yes, and i do not feel like i am a good person either. i do not want to blame everything on the others, my fault is also big here.i did not have a bad childhood. neither a good one. i do not remember much of it, even being only three years out of it. but there is not a single good thing i remember from it, only bad and embarassing things. my grandparents did not make a normal attempt at trying to raise me, i feel like i was raised by myself. just providing me with food and roof until i magically become an adult. and i did not ask them for anything either, i did not even have a smartphone before i entered university when it became a nessecity. graduating from school, i thought i would kill myself, but i did not. it was more than a thought and a little less than an attempt. did not have the bravery. thinking back on that, it was pretty comforting, not trying to improve anything in your life, thinking you would be dead anyways when life strikes you with the need to become a socially acceptable person.yes, i am an egoist. i want to live by myself, for myself, alone. in a crappy apartment, with no real life contacts, working online and only going outside to buy food. i would even be fine if i had to give 50 of my income to my family if the other 50 can pay me for rent and food. i am sure i would be happy this way. what, is there no place for egoists in our society? do i have to live the same crappy life all my damn family is living? or is this just me being depressed about my life, who does not understand other people, who are not depressed. like, what these people are living for?the moment that made me write this post happened a couple of days ago. my grandmother knocked on my door and said that she was screaming my name several times and that she did not feel well and needed me to bring her water. i think i was listeting to music that moment, not really loud i can understand now why i am not listeting to music at higher volume, it is the moments like this. and my grandfather was unconsious from all the fucking alcohol at the time. the only thing i said to her was that i would hear her if she was screaming. this was literally the first time she was feeling like that in several months. i feel like i do not have a single minute to relax, i am always stressed because something like this can happen and i always can be interrupted even if it is not shit like that. like, i feel that if i just tell everyone to fuck off and let me study in peace, i would have much more motivation to actually study and not stare into the fucking screen waiting for something to happen. but i cannot do that. i did not make an impression of being such a person. i act like i am fine and everything is fine. not that someone actually cares if i am fine or not.you think if i am saying all that i actually did consider asking them if i can move out in future or not. i did not. i am afraid to. but i think that they will that i can. what will happen then? currently i am the only helping my grandmother in our huge fucking garden and i did a lot of work there by myself. her health is progressively worsening, and my grandfather continues to drink alcohol. so the things are going to get even worse without me being around.i would love to be a person who would say 'fuck all of that'. can i be that person? what should i do? i ask these questions mostly to myself, but if you read that far into my post i would be happy to hear your opinion or advice on my situation. thanks. 21m and need an advice",Depression

35564,"chest pain anxiety. chd amp open heart surgery survivor. apologies for this wall of text. i just need help. so i'm new to reddit and to this sub. i know that chest pain is a very common symptomtrigger of ha, but i haven't been able to find any resources about cases similar to my own, although i'm sure they must exist out there. so i am a moderately healthy 25 year old woman. i excersise, i eat healthy, i was slightly overweight as a teen, but i've been at a healthy weight for the past 45 years. i was born with a somewhat serious congenital heart defect chd, an atrial septal defect asd to pe precise. at the age of 5 i received corrective surgery for this defect, and have been considered healthy and symptom free ever since this surgery. i have had no major health events since this time, and i have never had any sort of restrictions placed on my physical activity levels by my cardiologist. 4 years ago i entered into a long distance relationship with the man who would eventually become my husband, and it was around this time that my ha began. i believe it was triggered by my fears that something would happen to one of us while we were apart, and that we would never see each other again because of sudden death due to illness or a freak accident. i began to be plagued by images of him dropping dead of a heart attack or getting hit by a car same for myself. we lived in 2 different countries, and usually spent 89 months apart in between brief visits, and as our time apart progressed i was aware of new unhealthy habits forming googling symptoms, anxiety induced nauseachest painsnumbnesstinglingjaw pain. we are now married and have been living together for a year, and although i am happier than ever, all of my bad ha related habits have decided to make a home in my brain. i feel so unlike myself as i have never expeirenced anything quite like this before. i was so caught up with dealing with a long distanceinternational relationship that i didn't do anything to stop the progress of this anxiety and now it has become an integral part of my day to day life. like many of you i experience chest pain, numbness, tightness, tingling, and nausea, and i have been to see my doctor on a few of these occasions, and have been told that i am fine. i have even been to the hospital same results. again, i know this is all very common for those suffering from ha. my added complication comes from my history of heart defectheart surgery. i wish that i could just erase my knowledge of this event since it really exacerbates my ha and often sends me into a spiral. although i know most of my chest pains are benign, the fact that i have had major surgery lends just a bit more credence to the ha voice telling me i'm dying, and this is destroying my mental and physical health. it doesn't help that i can't find any resources on living postop from a pediatric heart surgery in your 20's30's, and what to expect as you age. all of the materials i find online about what to expect after a heart surgery are clearly directed towards 55 year olds, which is very alienating. i am always the youngest person in the cardiologist's office by several decades, and i've never met another person in my age group that has had open heart surgery. i've looked for support groups for young adults living postop from chd's, but i haven't been able to find anything. my question is this. does anyone on here relate to my storysituation? does anyone here have a history of chd and open heart surgery? since i can't find any information about this, my ha is telling me this is because they all died young and my time is limited, although i know this cannot be true. i just want to talk to someone about their experience with this and get support from people who know where i'm coming from. ah and chd open heart surgery are an abundantly shitty combination and i know my current anxiety levels are unsustainable. i can't live like this. even if you haven't had open heart surgery, any adviceresources would be welcome. i'm very overwhelmed and not sure how to deal with this.",Anxiety

20696,"this is the 4th silent breakdown i got from the span of 5 hours. i tried to dismiss the pang in my throat bc i did not want my family to notice i am on the verge of crying. i may have joked a lot of times about being the first one to die. idk maybe i am an asshole for being interested in my family's reaction once they see me in my deathbed. i do not know my mental state, since i am not financially independent to go secretly get myself a shrink so here i am in suicide watch writing this post. i have been feeling depressed for the last 5 years, i suddenly get upset and have this pain in my throat that really hurts. i tried opening up to my parents that my tendencies of suicidal ideation had tremendously increased especially this year. but unfortunately they are the type that does not believe in such illnesses and only brand them as made up stuffs for people that are seeking attention. i tried to open up but in return they just said i am copying my bestfriend my bestfriend was diagnosed with major depressive disorder along with bpd and i easily let the demons fester inside of me bc i do not go to church that much anymore. maybe they do have a point, but i am still uncertain i cannot go selfdiagnose since i am not a professional and maybe i am also overreacting. but there are times where i really want to end it right there and there, but i am too much of a coward to hurt myself so rather i tend to distract myself by either researching on painless death or just indulge in fictional literatures. maybe i do not want to die, maybe i just want to disappear for a while because everything suddenly feels overwhelming and it is exhausting and hurting at the same time. i want to open up to my friend but i do not want to bother them knowing they have their scars too, maybe even deeper than mine. i have been trying to distract myself, it is what i have been doing for the past 5 years. during the first year, i just sleep it all off whenever i notice these dangerous thoughts randomly popping up, but then suddenly they became more enticing? more louder. the fact that i cannot sleep so in return i tried to find a new way, which is indulging myself into the fictional world. but now it seems it keeps getting worse the more i try to ignore them, maybe 5 years is my limit. i managed to keep my wrist clean but now i have been trying to slice it although the minute i notice i am doing it i immediately back off whenever my parents nag about my slothful behavior i keep getting reminded of the awful threats i have thrown to them, making me feel guilty and even feel more like a piece of shit. when they told me i am just copying my mentally ill bestfriend just to garner attention, it felt like they pushed a button. i spouted nonsense angrily and even threatened them that i would really kill myself. and then it felt like they were mocking me knowing those were just empty words, and i do not have the courage to do it. in addition they also guilt trip me that i will not be able to spend my time in heaven with them, since i will be rotting in hell. because of that the thoughts of killing myself just to tell them see ma, pa, i could do it multiplied. i feel guilty for thinking this way because despite them being ignorant about mental health, they never lacked in other aspects. i know they care a lot about me in their own ways, that is they were always trying to provide me mh needs. the audacity i have to tell them such hurtful words adds up to the guilt that has been keeping me up at night. maybe i am just being a brat. idk i am just really tired, i want to start all over again. i have been thinking of killing myself on the 6th of september. i probably back out again knowing i am a coward. maybe that is a good thing, i do not even have the courage to slit my wrist. maybe i really am just an attention seeker but if there is one thing i know, i know my feelings are true and not certainly made up. this is so messy and my grammar is terrible but thanks for letting me post this mindlessly typing until my throat does not hurt anymore",Suicidal

7770,"remember that all we have is 'on loan' from fortune, which can reclaim it without our permission indeed, without even advance notice. thus, we should love all our dear ones, but always with the thought that we have no promise that we may keep them forever nay, no promise even that we may keep them for long. lucius annaeus seneca cannot find the sourcethe most sobering thought is losing what we care about. would we be able to move on, survive and flourish without our loved ones, whether they have passed on or we have? some of us, i think. i can say that i have experienced enough of loss to understand that life goes on with or without me, and i can say that i would feel a pang of sadness whensoever their memory comes to mind. but i feel i would do this survival thing just as well if not better after that loss.i would not sully their memory by grieving them for the rest of mine. i would remember them by being better than they remember, so that, should we reunite wherever the universe decides we do, they would enjoy seeing me again, and sharing in my joys instead of my sorrows. i would like to imagine that this is how the old peoples did it.bare with me, i have a silly idea that maybe, when the norse, greeks, egyptians, celtics and more, spoke about the idea of death, and what it was to live life after because surely they did, they sat around their grand tables, talking of stories they heard as children, told to them by their parents, who were in turn told by their parents, and so on until the first story was made up in an answer to the age old question no one can answer. what happens after death? on a side note, i like to think the first story ever came to existence because a a child had asked this in front of the elder of the tribe, who had made his living from leading the tribe that trusted him. this elder never would have led his people wrong, and they would have led a happy, content life. this elder would be the one the whole tribe went to for advice. so of course, he did not want to let the child down. so he told a story. something from his dreams that were impossible. and he took bits from others dreams and weaved a world after death.and people believed it. because the elder never lied to them. the elder always led them in the right direction. the elder had lived the longest so the elder knew more than they they. the elder experienced the most out of them all. the elder would know. so they added to his story on death, and made up the gods, and the fantastical dragons, and other beasts of lore. they made up their magics and prophecies. all chasing after their own form of heaven after death, while others would forever be stuck in a hell of their own making. so that is how we got these gods and myths and legends. and that is why stories are so powerful, especially for a child's imagination. the fortunate child who does not fully understand the idea of loss and death, and is fueled on bedtime tales. until they experience it, of course. and then they have to rely on what is told to them by the elders they know, and they carry that with them. and so it creates a ripple effect, their idea of after life pervading into all that they say and do. and that is how they cope with losing loved ones. they tell themselves over and over again, they are in odin's hall, or at arthur's table, drinking their mead and telling their tales of glory. being happy. so if, after you die, you go to join them at the table, and they want to hear your tales of glory, would you tell sad stories about how you have missed them, and how your life fell apart after they left you, and you got worse and all these bad things happened? would you tell you them that you have lived poorly because they were your only reason for being happy? or would you tell tall tales of how you fought the bad dragons of the world just to make it a better place for their children, for their loved ones, and for yours. would you tell them that they inspired you to new heights. you did they things they did not get to, and you can tell them what it is like. to do the former is to blame them for their death, and how hurtful is that to someone you loved? to tell them that their death, their inescapable cycle of life, made their loved ones lives in this already inescapable hell we live in, worse.but to do the latter is to truly put them at rest, at peace. knowing that their loved ones have thrived without them, have lived and have known a great amount of joy after the universe has given you your time. that they have made the world better, have made life more fun to live. or at the least, have a good story to tell. to bring it back, i want to dissect what i feel is the most important part of seneca's statement, that we should love all our dear ones. we do not know when we will lose them, although if you are losing them because of your actions, you should be well aware of those consequences. so while we share our lives and experiences with them, we should show our love for them. we should share our joys, and try to be better for their sake, if not our own.after all, no one wants to sit at a table and share drugs with the inconsiderate, deceitful, abusive, prideful, greedy, and murderous. i do not think i need to explain why. live life loving, and you will love after life",Depression

35224,"actual problems mixed with anxiety i have one legitimate issue that i will get an appointment for on monday sadly, the weekend is inbetween. my bpm, which usually is around 5565, got higher and flip flops around a lot it is between 80 and 100 now when i am sitting or lying down and my bloodpressure similarly got a tad higher not to worrying heights, it is below 140 and, what is worrying me, flip flops around a lot when i take several measurements like going from 100 to 130 and back several times when i do not move and measure 10 times over the course of some minutes, even when i am sitting still and relaxed. this is an issue i legitimately think might have to do with my thyroids no cancer fears about the thyroids, i think it might just be hyperactive and that makes sense because i am celiac and celiacs often have other autoimmune diseases, most commonly thyroid stuff. now to what actually makes me scared and is probably nothing today, after a long time of it not happening happened a lot before my celiac diagnosis, my whole body vibrated with my pulse i could feel it everywhere, most importantly neck, my pulse was actually off too high, above 100 even when sitting, sometimes going as far as near 120 and i felt pressure in my gutts and chest. the pressure was so bad that, depending on how i moved, it felt like organs press on organs and i felt sick. my neck was not only vibrating with my pulse, it also got very tensed not some kind of stiffness that made it unable to move, but i felt like someone grabbed me just at the start of the back of my head and pressed his finger into it, shutting down the blood flow except for the very strong pulsations. i had these symptoms before more or less as i said, and i assume that it is roemheld syndrome a benign, but very scary kind of thing because i know that my heart is fine. it got very thoroughly checked back then and it was fine in the months before, i could do sports, i am not feeling weak, i am not having syncopes. roemheld syndrome means that you got so much pressure in your gutts due to air and food that it presses against your heart, chest and lungs so you experience very scary sensations, similar to angina pectoris, but it is not actually dangerous. your heart rate is increased, your chest feels tight, you might have shortness of breath, but you are going to be fine once the pressure is gone. but that can take a long time and in that time you think you will die and you need to go to the er. i had that today, the first time in almost a year and i was kinda broken that it came back. i thought i beat it, and then suddenly here i am, thinking i got a lung emboli, or my veins are shut down, or there is a tumor pressing on my heart or veins. or i got a brain aneurysm because i also felt pulsations in my head and heard noises in my air i dont think these are noises it usually makes when you got very high bp, since my bp is not actually that high and it was only one air and i got a head mrt the year before and it was fine. now, i am very sure that roemheld is what caused this, because yesterday i drank a lot of booze and cola while eating and i had a bit of pressure before that to begin with, but the reason that i am still like 'ya, gonna die' is that i lost so much weight compared to last time. i lost more than 10 kilo so there should be far more space for my innards. i am not overweight anymore. so, what my anxiety brain thinks is this back then, a tumor right behind my sternum, pressing on my heart. ofc the pressure got better when i lost weight and stuff, but now it grew enough to make up for it and it presses again against my heart and no doctor will check for that obviously the tumor is not visible via sono but needs mrt or ct and at some point it will just destroy my heart and i will die. or my neck or bones presses on important veins and i will also die because the vein will burst even tho i had an mrt of the neck for legit reasons just 2 months ago and while my neck had issues, noone said anything about veins. ampx200b i am fine now because i drank a lot of herbal tea that helps with roemheld, but i am still here thinking about tumors and also thyroid cancer. as a bonus point, i think about it even being my own fault because i might have ingested gluten accidently i probably didnt, but i live, for some time, with a non celiac so there is some chance there was contamination of my food, but he is careful and i am too, so it aint probable and the gluten made the belly angry. i really hope this was a one time thing and i am not falling back into anxiety due to roemheld, i will be extra careful about food in the next days. i will not eat today until the belly died down and sadly my eating choice are limited due to celiac in any case, not a lot of good 'get healthy' food, at least not in my flat and drink very much of the herbal tea. ampx200b when i feel better, i will do some sit ups and push ops to try to straighten out my belly

48950,"i had a mental breakdown at work and nearly lost my job this happened last friday. i have always had an anxiety disorder and it has been worse with all the stress i have been under lately both at work as well as at home. i work for gm which everyone who don't work there knows as a good job, but in reality it has gone to shit. i was hired 16 years ago and was in the last group to get traditional pay, benefits, and a retirement plan so i can't find anything else that pays the same. anyone hired after me is really fucked and there is a reason gm can't keep any of the new employees. i work in material handling and the company is working up towards outsourcing and cutting those jobs so they are cutting out full teams and overloading everyone that's left then telling us everything's going to change soon, just make it work for the next year i have some serious stuff going on at home that i don't want to get into and it just makes the work stress that much worse. on friday i messed up, i knew i messed up and wasn't mad about getting written up or anything but the thing is, i spend 90 of my waking life and my first ever anxiety attack was while i was asleep, i woke up thinking i was having a heart attack so probably my sleeping life also feeling like something terrible is going to happen due to my anxiety. when i get in trouble, it felt like the end of the world. i took my break and paced around outside debating if i should call in my fmla and leave work but when i came back something very small and stupid happened that set me off. i blew up on my group leader screaming at her that i can't fucking do this! even though i hate gm she is the nicest lady and easily the best boss i have ever had and i feel like a complete scumbag. she tried to fire me and the union got it down to a suspension but i honestly couldn't feel worse if i had been fired. i'm so ashamed of myself for how i acted and have been in a deep depression for the last few days and haven't done much more than lay in bed crying. the worst part is that she thinks i did it because i was mad about the write up and thought i could bully her because she is a woman and week, apparently she has faced discrimination in previous jobs. i hate myself, i'm ashamed of myself, and even though i didn't get fired i feel like nothing will ever be ok again.",Stress

7344,"burner account for obvious reasons.it is so hard to have to seem like i am alright 247. nobody asks me how i am doing. nobody reaches out to me first. i could go days without meaningful conversation. my childhood was beyond fucked up. my father killed himself and my mother became addicted to drugs. my siblings and i were neglected. i was molested by another kid in the foster home that i stayed at for 2 months, and told nobody because i was ashamed that it happened to me as a male. my siblings and i stayed with our single grandmother for 2 grueling years until she could not take care of 4 children anymore. she sent my two sisters back into foster care, and for that i cannot blame her. i never got to say goodbye so i feel like they died, and there were suddenly less people who truly understood what i have gone through.i finished my last year of middle school and all of high school constantly hiding my depression. some days are fine and other days are miserable. however, i never let it show how hopeless i was. when my grandmother and i would fight over the smallest things she took me to therapy for a few weeks of my junior year. she thought i had anger issues, but i truly do not so i got diagnosed with an undeclared mood disorder. i just did not want to open up too random stranger about anything. my uncle asked me once in my freshman or sophomore year of high school if i was depressed and i lied and said no. i have not opened up to anyone because, as a male, people are uncomfortable when we show vulnerability. i hate crying in front of others.covid robbed me of the rest of my senior year of high school. i lost connection with the friends i was making and some of the friends i had. i have never felt more alone in life now than ever. i cannot remember the last time i left the house to spend time with friends. if i stop reaching out nobody will bother to check and see how i am doing. i live a meaningless life and i am expected to suck it up and work a full time job that i dislike very much. i am uncertain of what career path will help me most in my future. my grandmother ensures me that my time at her home is very limited and that it is not a safety net. i am very sure that i will end up killing myself in the near future. my brother already has bipolar depression, so i am worried that if i end my life he will suffer. i know that everyone else that has been in my life will forget about me soon after. they probably hate how closed off i am, but the primary reason i close myself off is to spare them from the pessimism that i keep inside me day to day. i am not going to burden other people with my suffering. so since i am i coward who cannot kill himself, enjoy the vague, depressing haha essay that i typed. i just wanted to get this out here so i feel less alone. do not reach out to me to tell me it gets better. its a shallow phrase used by people lucky enough to have had people who care enter their life. good for you. i might never come to check if my post was recognized because i really do not care. i just wanted to vent.sorry for being self centered here. sorry if some things made no sense.sorry for wasting your time.i will not end my life anytime soon, but later most likely. i am 19 and already very tired. thanks for reading i am going to off myself as soon as i get the courage.",Depression

10511,"long story short. i hadhave an alcohol addiction that led to my now ex breaking up with me last month june. over the last 7 months leading up to the break up i quit drinking, entered therapy and started taking medication because i did love her and wanted to be better for her. she always asked if i hated her which was never true. i loved her more than i can describe and constantly questioned myself about why i was actively pushing her away. i could not stop myself. the truth was that i never hated her its that i hated that she loved me which i will never understand. during the month of the breakup junei started and quit a job that i actually enjoyed due to two very toxic old men who were miserable and bitter. i sent one of them a nasty text due to his petty response to me quitting. i woke up the next day after quitting the job only to find out my now ex is seeing someone else which led me to wonder if she had been fucking this guy every time she went out of state to visit her grandmother. she would visit her grandmother out of state every six months or so. i had doubts trust issues but doubts remain doubts unless there is evidence. i managed to find a new job within a day of all of this happening and quit that job tonight after my very first shift because i did not think id be a good fit i tried to trick myself in to thinking i am changing or becoming a better version of myself but the truth is that i feel more lost than ever. i have told women in the past i loved them but i did not really love them. i just did not want to be lonely and relied on them to make me happy since could not find it within myself. i met my now ex and was head over heels. i wanted to be better for her and for myself. i just could not trust her or allow myself to be vulnerable. i know i have been depressed due to my lack of interest in wanting to do anything, sleeping more, eating less. i feel myself shutting down emotionally but i am trying to fight it off and i am losing. being sober has been difficult for me because i have to confront all of the shit i actively ignored for the last 2 decades and i do not know how to handle it. i wake up everyday wishing i died in my sleep.as much as i want to end it i am too afraid of death but i am also scared of living. i feel like a broken watch stuck on the time doomed to repeat the same mistakes. i have no purpose, no drive, no hope, no faith. i feel broken and i do not know what to do. i feel like a monster. i feel i deserve to be punished for everything i have ever done and everything i did not do. i have no friends, no partner who i can wake up next to every day and no future. karma has a way of showing you who you are. i feel like my only purpose in life is to project my self hatred and anger on to others and i hurt them because of it. so what is the point? i feel defeated, weak, unable to succeed or be normal.",Depression

8221,"do not really know where to start so i am going to recount my life a bit. i am a moderately healthy 16yearold, who started high school last year. in my country we start high school as 15yearolds. my family is not wealthy but we are not in any serious financial trouble. my parents are still together and i would say they raised me pretty well considering. i have an older brother and an older sister, who both moved out years ago to live their own lives but i am still really close to both of them. i love my family and my pets a lot. right now i think they are the only reason i am still breathing.i have been anxiety ridden and suicidal for about my entire life. i had really bad separation anxiety as a kid so my mom watched over me at home. i did not go to kindergarten because of it. when school started, i used to spend an hour in the bathroom just vomiting bile every morning because of my anxiety. my stomach ached and i was trembling every morning for years. i was just too scared to go to school, because it was a new enviroment and because my teacher was in my opinion really frightning. i missed entire weeks maybe even months from school. i made plenty of friends but nothing could make me enjoy school since everyday i was just a ball of anxiety that was too afraid to do anything. at the age of seven i held a knife to my throat and threatened to kill myself just so i did not have to go to school anymore. that is how much i hated it.obviously this was not normal behaviour for a kid so my parents put me in therapy. for years it was absolutely useless. they just made me do these weird excersises which i am starting to think was just some random busy work to keep me entertained. the only thing that helped was that they advised my parents to help me prepare for different things. for example if i had a field trip in a month to a zoo, my parents would take me and my siblings there together so i would have an easier time to go there again. this helped for a while but of course in life you cannot prepare for everything. my anxiety never went away but things became easier for a couple of years.when i was about to advance to seventh grade 13yearold me my anxiety was still there but thing were going well. couple of years pass and my anxiety is going up and down in waves but the school was very understanding and complying, all my best friends were on the same class as me, i had a clear image of the future and my individual therapy was going well. life was going really well at this point and even though i was anxious i could go to school pretty normally even though i still missed many days. at it is peak my anxiety could because me to have migraines so i had to stay home a lot. whenever things were going bad i thought about suicide but never planned it out.on my last year before high school my anxiety just skyrocketed and with it i became very depressed. i was not too outgoing before but now i could not even go to the store without anyone else. i did not want see or talk to any of my friends even though i really liked being with them. before i was a staight a student but i could not even understand the words on my homework anymore. i was a perfectionist yet i did not care if i finished my assinments anymore. my grades dropped heavily. smallest decisions became just unbearable to make. on some nights i did not eat because i could not choose what to eat even though the fridge would have been full. some days i could not get out of bed. so many of my hobbies became untouched. i could not play games like before, i could not play he piano anymore and i could not write stories like i used to. i became entirely paralysed.my therapist was really worried about how i was feeling so they told my parents who had no idea. i was pretending to them that everything was just becoming harder in school and that i was otherwise doing just fine even though i was basically dying inside. my mother called my school and told them that she was pulling me out for 2 weeks to recover. i was basically just too overwhelmed and burned out that i was barely functioning. this was the first time i could really remember me putting a plan together to end my life. i was in so much pain. the only things i cared about doing did not bring me any joy just stress and my pride in my school succes was dwindling because i could not keep up anymore. the only reason i did not kill myself was because i did not want to die in pain and i had no idea how to kill myself without going through absolutely no pain. i have never told anyone about being suicidal anymore. not to my family, not to my friends and not to my therapist because i am afraid of he consequences.during that time my parents prohibited me from looking at any homework, news or worry about outside life. they wanted me to recover without any possible hindurances and because of that they tried to bring me my favorite foods and give me lots of free time so i could enjoy my time playing games. i have never felt so relieved. before that i was crying in my bed at night just dreading for the next schoolday the freedom of not having to worry about anything was amazing. at the end of those two weeks i returned to school. i was doing fine for a few days but as the school year was coming to an end i was beginning to feel a lot worse again. all that pressure from school life and my own mind had not disappeared. i had just pushed them away from my mind. i became the bitter and sad hermit who disappeared back into my room like i never left.that same old feeling of freedom returned when summer came and my school year ended. no pressure, no expectations. i did not see my friends during that entire holiday or go anywhere from my home. i was happy and safe in my room even though just outside my window i could see how wonderful the weather was outside. i could finally do the things i liked again and i could actually enjoy them this time.that did not last of course because then i went to high school to continue my studies. to my surprise the first weeks went well even though i was really anxious. two of my best friends were still in the same school and we had lots of the same classes. i spent every moment with them and i had fun. the problems started when i could not go to any of the tests because of my anxiety. i failed a lot of courses because of it and those set backs started an unstoppable snowballeffect. my selfesteem was in the gutter and i started to hide in my room again. i slowly became me from before that two week vacation. i became more depressed again and more anxious then ever. i could not go to classes. i could not do my homework and i couln't participate in any group activity. i started failing more classes even on subjects that i previously could have aced with my eyes closed. i spent almost three days every week suffering from migraines.for the last 67 months i have not been to school at all. i have met doctors and i have met with my guidance counselor for more times then i can count. my anxiety is through the roof and each time i explain my problems to the doctors and my guidance counselor, the answer is always we know it is hard for you to go to school because x,y and z. you just need to try going to school.like i had not fucking thought of that before. i am suffering inside my own head, thoughts screaming how i cannot do shit and how behind i am going to be and how useless i am. for every day i started crying because i was so afraid of going to school. i could not read anything because i just could not understand the alphabets. i am nearly having panic attacks when i just think about going school. one day i became so enraged that i punched my door hoping that i would break my own arm. but thanks, i had not thought of going to school. right now i have been on summer break again but in a week i need to go back to school but i just do not know how i can. i start crying every time i think about school. i just want to disappear and thinking about killing myself has become an everyday occurance. i just cannot handle feeling this hopeless and anxious every day when i have not even started to live independently yet. i am terrified.any advicestories from personal experience or just kind words would be very much appriciated.thanks for reading this far feeling lost, this is my

11432,"i am 17f, asian.for my entire childhood my mom has projected her insecurities onto me, a behavior which has manifested into relentless cruelty and emotional torture. she used to hit me a lot i still have a scar from when she hurled her keys at my face because i told a friend that she had called me a curse but stopped when cps came. she has incessantly berated and demeaned me for over a decade, to a point of viciousness words cannot describe. whether that is trying to force me to kill myself or calling me a worthless fucking idiot or shrieking at me that i am a maniac who everyone thinks should be locked up, the pain she has caused me is indescribable. every single day she terrorizes me with insults, comparisons, belittling, threats and manipulation. and i do not know if i will ever be able to recover from the anguish.but whenever i obey her she is nice to me and acts like a good mother. i know the love is real, albeit conditional, and it will disappear the moment things do not go her way. but i try so so hard to keep her in a good mood because i just need her affection so badly. i hate myself so much for this.my father is more normal but he has bursts of uncontrollable rage when things do not go his way. i try not to think about these times because other times he loves me very much. i would like to emphasize that he is very kind to me usually. but these outbursts include physical assault, smashing stuff, death threats, suicide threats, and really mean comments to me like 'i bet you get orgasms from destroying the family like the sociopath you are'.but that is not very common so i do not want to focus on that. what is more common is his enabling of my moms behavior. he always sat back in silence on his phone whenever my mom was shrieking at me and always pretended it never happened. he never validates my feelings and always jumps to comments like 'nothing will ever satisfy you' and 'your mom does so much for you why are you so ungrateful you bitch'. he always sided with her and her bullshit narrative about the family dynamic essentially i ruined everyone is happiness. it is so frustrating especially when i am begging and crying for him to intervene but he just tells me to shut up and go away and listen to my mother.anyway yesterday my mom was screaming at me as usual because i had not finished a college essay draft. she said something along the lines of how my dad always tells her how he thinks i should be locked up in a mental institution, how he wishes he had his friends daughters instead of me and how he cannot wait for me to be out of his life. i felt really sad about this for some reason even though they have said things like this to me since i was 9.my dad was driving me back home from a dr appt today when i for some dumbass reason asked him if what he had said was true. he obviously got very defensive and skirted around the question and claimed i was always searching for stuff to be mad about, that i was always blaming my problems on my parents, and he did not know what to do to satisfy me. this really upset me as all i want is a loving peaceful family. i will admit it, i called him a bad father. i was so angry by him invalidating me and making it look like such a simple request was absurd and ungrateful. i hate how they will always see me as overemotional and dramatic and selfish without ever looking inward and recognizing their flaws. well anyway that made him super mad and he basically said that he hated me and my mom, and marrying her was the worst decision of his life, that he had stopped loving her years ago and it was all my fault. he said that the family was not worth resurrecting and the only reason he had not left andor killed himself was to preserve his reputation. when i got home i went and cried to my mother and told her she was right, that i am a failure, and i begged her to hug me. she hugged and kissed me and i felt so much better. she got impatient pretty fast but i did not care. i just wanted someone to love me. i feel so much self loathing for not being strong enough to withstand a family deprived of love. i hate that i am relinquishing my autonomy and purpose and strength just to feel some love from my parents. it sucks. idk if this is depression or a coping mechanism or what. i do not know how to keep going on. anyway sorry for rant ty for reading if you got this far both my parents are incredibly cruel to me but sometimes i am so desperate to fill the void i abandon all my morals and appease them so i can get some affection. i viscerally hate myself for this. is that depression?",Depression

11330,"tomorrow's my last shift at a job that had become nothing but a source of anger, frustration, and toxic energy that turned me into a person i do not want to be anymore. i recently went on a family trip and i was actively angry that i had to go back to working there when i got back. a week later i put in my notice. no regrets on getting out of a situation that made me feel like i was going through the motions, like i was just a character in a video game playing out my script until clocking out, like my input or ideas or suggestions were not listened to or i agree with you but other person said no.no regrets, that is, other than leaving when i had nothing else lined up after. now it feels like the only jobs i will ever be able to get are things that i will end up hating just as much. and the career path i would like to pursue is impractical, untenable, unrealistic, and i should just stop fooling myself into thinking it is possible, so i might as well just accept that i am never going to be happy in what i do for a living.i had been telling myself that i needed to get the 900pound gorilla off my back before i could move on in a healthy way. nope, you just could not put up with a standard retail job. get over yourself, your dreams are pointless, just give up now, and put the customer service voice back on.i would been telling myself do not leave a job unless you have another job. yeah, and you did not ever look for other jobs while you were working because you were too stressed out and exhausted or more realistically lazy and like to complain from your current job that thinking about work became the last thing you wanted to do so you would just wallow in it. and now that you are at the exit ramp, you still have nothing to show for it. why? because you are fucking lazy and you need to accept the fact that this is all you are ever going to be. just give up and get back to work.i would been telling myself work yourself out of a job so they will either have to promote you or you go somewhere else and do the next step on that ladder. even if they did promote you, that just would have kept you stuck there even longer, or if you went somewhere else you would be still doing the same thing you hate. which is the only thing you are ever going to get paid to do, anyway, so suck it up and put the tags back on.the only thing i have ever truly wanted to do with my life, and i mean across all of my years of existence, is to put on a show, make people laugh, and help them forget about their problems for a while. but i am not a good enough actorwritercomedianperformeranything to get paid to do that for anyone else, i know i would never succeed trying to start something on my own, and the wild card option i keep toying with is unrealistic for many reasons, most notably because i am already probably too old to start and i would be even older by the time i was good enough.so i might as well just accept that all i am ever meant to do is suck it up, accept my fate, and go through the motions of living doing something that will never let me be happy. tomorrow's my last day at my job, i do not have anything else lined up, and i see no hope.",Depression

tldr i feel like i should just move on and try to do what i should do. but i cannot help but not know how to deal with the fact that i wasted months during grad school when i fucking to a scholarship. i should have taken a leave of absence instead. logically i know that there are some things that one should just move on from. and just deal with it and move on. at this point accept that shit happened, and try to do what i can. but how to deal with the whole mess up and how i obviously have to make a good impression. where even right now, i am still struggling with getting my self to work due to developed ergophobia. obviously step by step for this one. but dammit i cry. apologies for this long post. tt how do i get over the wasted time i did during grad school due to depressionanxiety?",Depression

21858,"i constantly repeat to myself that i have never really been given a fighting chance. quite honestly all the odds are against me and i have spent so long fighting and i am just tired. i grew up with abusive parents, i am mixed so my mom is a stereotypical chinese mom. she was brutal in ways a lot of daughters of immigrant parents can relate to, physically, mentally, emotionally. she challenged me a lot academically, i started playing piano when i was 3 i was in advanced tutoring, ballet, i never really got a chance to be a kid. my dad on the other hand is something else, hes significantly older than my mom. he had a failed marriage and i was raised along my half sisters, i watched them get treated awfully by him until their mom took them away. that caused me to have a lot of abandonment issues. my dad is not a good person. hes very religious and abuses it. he raised me teaching me i am an object, to fulfill male desire and pleasure and to create children. i was taught about purity and how my destiny is to make my husband happy, save my body for him and create children. these teachings began when i was old enough to comprehend and continue even now. its traumatizing and this has caused me to develop sexual triggers concerning my anxiety and ocd diagnoses. its made iy impossible for me to have healthy relationships, or have sex. i feel like my body and my heart are broken. it does not help that he sexualized me significantly while also teaching me to hate my body. it confused me. he would hit me a lot, but he would do it while saying he loved me. i am just really confused. i was under a lot of pressure in every area, my parents are successful business people they trained me to adhere to productivity culture. they would always tell me i am on my own and need to learn to work. when i was 10 i got severely ill. auto immune disease. it was very severe and i was practically living in hospitals until i was 14. i could not go to school, i lost the majority of my friends. i had tried extreme diets, chemotherapy, steroids, i had a feeding type for two years, and ultimately had a surgery to remove an organ. during the times i was really sick the abuse and mistreatment would stop and as sick as it sounds id almost be thankful for being unwell so i would not be hurt so badly. my illness made me so mad though. ever since i was 8 id tell myself every day 10 more years you can run away you will be out of here you will be independent just make it to 18 my illness resulted in a physical disability and since its autoimmune i live with the fear iy could come back at any time now i am forever dependent on my parents for money and health insurance and i can never be free from them. i am so angry about this, all i ever wanted was to be free and that caused me to not be. i am interested in psychology i read a lot of research surrounding trauma and i know very well that my illness could be a direct because of the abuse. i guess my soul just could not take it, i feel weak. every time id get better the abuse would begin again. we have had cps visits, lots of people are concerned. my parents made up a lie i have autism so when teachers or health care providers are worried about how anxious i am amongst other signs of abuse they have something to cover it up with. they say they have always suspected me to have autism they try to convince me to fake certain traits when they take me in for testing. i know better and i know what its all about. i feel like a lot of people failed me. eventually when i got smart enough to get help on my own my parents told me of how my illness can come at any time and if i were to leave and go to foster care they would not be able to help me get the best medical care. and at times i need constant medical care. a really difficult situation as you can see. before i could tell myself 18 and i am gone and all of a sudden i did not even know if that is possible anymore. eventually i got better do go surgery and i was able to be fully normal again i went back to school made a lot of friends and developed a plan to become financially stable by the time i am 18. i was not allowed to go out hardly ever, while i was sick i could never leave home and they would punish me in ways such as taking away electronics, wifi, books etc. so id be forced to be in a room with no distractions at all. i knew these punishments could come back so i had to think smart. i began building a persona and platform online through different social media platforms. i marketed myself as a teen creator, photography, fashion etc. like an influencer basically. more than anything i value my privacy and i know how sad my life is so i hated portraying a happy teenager online i never wanted to be influencer i just wanted a platform so when the time came i could use it to create a business. over time i built a big platform i was featured in publications i had brand deals i was even invited to prestigious events. this did not result in much money, just experience. you would think id be proud of my accomplishments but i am not at all. i regret it more than anything, i hated being a 15 year old essentially selling myself like a product online. getting myself into situations and events filled with adults. i feel embarrassed for all the danger i put myself in online. i wish i could have still been able to be a kid. i kept pushing and pushing myself, my new endeavor was writing a book about my experiences as a teen influencer and my illness and such. i should not have done this. i spent a year doing this, it was essentially shadow work. by the end of it i realized how sad my life was, how all of this was not the result of passion or ambition just a desperate attempt of freedom. as a teenager i was never allowed to drive. i am turning 18 in a few days i still cannot drive. i cannot go anywhere without permission if i try to leave my house my parents call the cops on me which incites a panic attack. they know this and claim my panic attacks are of a mentally unstable person needing to go to a psyche ward. everyone i know tells me i remind them of britney spears, its sad. when covid quarantine was announced it was the worst day of my life. no one understood why i was freaking out so much, they did not realize that all my life i had been subject to extreme lockdowns. not being able to leave my house being stuck with them, i knew what it was like to never leave the house a house filled with so much awfulness. it was happening again. i had already realized how i wanted to step away from my online platform after realizing the real reason i did all of this. my parents are high risk as well as me so they went extreme for quarantine. since march 2020 up until may 2021 i was being held captive in my home. we had security systems set with a password only my mom knew, i could never leave. if i left my room i risk having a panic attack or being yelled at ao i stayed in my room for almost a year with no other human contact. all i had was social media this is awful for mental health and i am now left with severe depression anxiety and ocd. i had a boyfriend at the time, he was my first love, my everything really. we started dating a year before lockdown we only got serious a few months prior though. to say he was a miracle in my life is an understatement. before him i did not even know what love was or how i deserved to be treated, i had no idea what normal human kind interactions of love were, i had not even been able to cry for 5 years. he opened my heart up he helped me understand all that had happened to me and how it was not my fault. he knew how much i went through and how much i was going through he put his life on hold to help me feel as comfortable as i could while i was stuck in the house. he would stay on the phone with me every day, he would plan virtual movie dates, he would write me letters, he would stay on the phone while i napped or slept to make sure i did not have nightmares, he would drop off gifts and food for me. lockdown meant everyone working from home in my house and all food and grocerys delivered, it was intense. for a year and a half. during this time my friends all grew up, they are indecent now and although i still have close friends we drifted. my boyfriend was the only one who stayed by me helping me with everything. this time period caused me to decline mentally a lot, i took out all my anger at him, i was so mean to him id yell at him. i have ocd and because it is triggered by my fathers teachings it can make me think i do not love my boyfriend or it can make me think he has hurt me physicallysexuallymentally etc. id take out all my frustration on him. i was not a good girlfriend. he stayed by me though so patient never yelled never fought back he treated me with all the kindness i could have hoped to have when i was young. he knew how much i had been hurt and was still being hurt so he started working jobs to save up money to get me out once i turn 18, he contacted family to help him and help me. i felt guilty, him giving up his future for me. but he really did love me, he just wanted me to be happy and be there to see it. he knew about my disability and sickness he would help take care of me too. in january a lot of family issues arose, tragedies and death. i started spiraling then i was overwhelmed unbelievably overwhelmed i do not know exactly what happened a depressive episode maybe, manic episode i do not know. i broke up with my boyfriend out of no where. a mix of the guilt and just idk, i knew it was a mistake he was the only good thing in my life and my way out of this family but i broke up with him. its been 7 months we talk every day i want him back i tell him that but i hurt him so much i gave up on him when he never gave up on me. its too late for anything now, hes back on track with a new career plan and hes doing amazing. i am not. after i broke up with him i launched a online business reading astrological charts for people, i made an insane amount of money utilizing my social platforms. it robbed me of the passion i had for my hobby with astrology though, really burned me out. during quarantine to pass time i also became a certified doula. youngest to become one from the program i trained with. i have no patience i worked day and night to create my business materials and it failed, never got work except for birth fetishizers that scammed me into talking about birth with them. sick, traumatizing. this episode i had caused me to shut off emotion, i was unhinged just working my ass off just like before i met my boyfriend investing all my energy into work. then i had a wake up call, realized how unhappy and miserable i am having to conform to hustle entrepreneurial ship culture just for freedom. i want to drive, i want to get a job outside. i want to go to school. i do not want this i do not want this at all. i am allowed to go out now, but every time i do i get panic attacks. being in isolation for so long causes you to get overwhelm very easily. i can hardly function. my friends are all going to college now, i wanted to take a gap year to heal but i still have no independence. i lost it all i lost everything or maybe i just had nothing to begin with. my birthday is in a week. i get something i call birthday blues every birthday i feel so depressed and borderline suicidal. most of my birthdays in my childhood were traumatic, it would be a peak day of abuse and such so now every birthday i just wish i was dead. this one is going to be the worse. i spent my whole life looking forward to turning 18. it was going to be the day i am free. its not anymore. that was my only goal i told myself this every day ever single fucking day and now i am turning 18 with absolutely nothing. nothing. i have nothing. i fought for this long and for what. for absolutely nothing. i thought last year would be my worst birthday. my then boyfriend knew i would not be allowed out even if its just outside to say hi. so he created a big surprise for me full of my favorite things and left it outside for me all i wanted to do was bring it in and get my flowers and balloons. i love flowers and balloons and i realized a new security system had been set and i was now completely trapped in the house. my dad was crowding around me he scares me a lot i have not talked to him in over a year i cannot without panicking. hes scary. i ran to my room and sobbed all i wanted was to get my flowers and balloons. i locked myself in my room and cried all day, just like every year. my boyfriend was on the phone though. he would sing to me and tell me stories to help calm me down. hes not here anymore and no one else is either. my friends are all living their own grown up lives now. its just me now. and i told myself for years that all i had to do was turn 18 and it would be over. now its worse than ever. i feel hopeless, i have never been happy in my life, i live in isolation, i feel like i am being held captive. i have lost everything. i never had anything to begin with.",Depression

20037,"i am 17 and i have been depressed for almost as long as i can really remember. my last truly happy memory was probably when i was 5 and its laughably simple just laying between my parents in bed as the weather played on an old tv. a couple years ago my last grandpa died and i felt nothing at all. it made me feel gross that i did not.this year i told my doctor i was depressed and wanted to die. they gave me a therapist and medication. i have only ever lied to my therapist since. i have told my doctor all medications i have taken feel like placebos and do absolutely nothing except give me erectile disfunction, this is the only true thing i have said. in the last few months things have really gotten worse. my only really close friend that i would have done anything for just stopped wanting to hangout. i have been planning on bringing him backpacking and rowing and every single time despite expressing interest pulls out at the last second and it really hurts me because i love them and want to do things. then my boyfriend, the only person i have genuinely felt was the one for me, just stopped talking to me never officially breaking up but every time i try to talk to him he either goes quiet or gets irritable. it hurts so much because i love him so much and i genuinely wanted to spend the rest of my life with him and he had expressed that he felt similarly. and as of a month ago i have not a single friend. i have not really talked to anyone in a long while.then this week my grandma died and again i felt nothing despite having seen her the most out of my grandparents. i feel like i am a selfish monster to not feel anything when my family dies but be so torn up when everyone else leaves. i just feel like i do not belong here. i just want to reset it all. i have planned on killing myself before and just could not go though with it that feeling of wanting to die never left i just cannot do it myself. i just wish id die in some accident or something. ill never be normal. i cannot even look at myself in the mirror without wanting to rip my face off. i cannot even think without wanting to tear my brain out because of shear regret that i cannot just have a second chance. i hate myself and i do not even know why. i just want to close my eyes and never wake up. i do not have anywhere else to go and i just need someone to talk to",Suicidal

16579,"i want to start this off by saying that i might kill myself or at least i am considering too. i will not kill myself tonight or tomorrow, it is just something that lingers within me.i think about it mostly because i know that i will fail school royally. my teachers do not believe in me, my friends probably do not believe in me either and my mom is lying to herself. i know i am not able to do it because i am genuinely lazy, i promise this is no exaggeration, i really am lazy. i sometimes cannot bring myself to learn even if i wanted toi dread going back to school this summer, i dread living my life even though i have so many things to look forward to in life.big things like moving out, having a relationship, meeting some internet friends for the first time but also little things like a third season of my favourite show being announced, video games preordered, going out with friends and everything in between. however, all those things will, in the end, be outweighed by me failing everything.i feel like i reached an end, whether it is the end of my life or something more insignificant i cannot tell, but it is an end.i do not hate myself that much. i do not think i am depressed either. i am just tired. so, so tired. i am just scared of failing. i am just done with it.i am not prepared for life or any of what is to come. i have considered running away from home but that does not make sense.nothing makes sense about my situation. i have tried, i swear to god i fucking tried. i would organise my papers and books for school and reflect every evening on what i learned in school but after two weeks or so i would just slowly stop. i tried that method so fucking often but it just does not work.my grades are not bad by any means, they are truly good. so i do not know why i am stressing out like this. this is just me rambling about some shit, none of what i am writing has any form of structure and i am sorry for that.can anyone please give me advice on how to be a better person? sorry if what i am saying is not appropriate for this subreddit i just do not know who to talk to. sorry if my english is bad i am not from an english speaking country. i feel like i am failing.",Suicidal
19634,"what triggered metoday i found out that the father of my ex best friends died. i was shocked and sad even tho i am not friends with them anymore i still feel bad for them. in the last few months i thought about what would i do if something happened to my parentswell probably die right after. the reality hit me like a truck with the death of their father, which showed me the reality. i am basically living for my parents, this would be terrifying to me because besides them no one cares about me, and i do not have anyone else who i care about. i am now 18 years old and horrified of life, the main thing why is because i cannot live with myself. i just hate myself so much that i cannot participate in any hobbies or do stuff i need to do to live a good life i just feel empty but also guilty because not everyone has privileges that i do. i do not want to be myself, i never wanted to be. i am a mdder, because of that i do not live in the real world but escape into my fantasies. instead of doing this shit which does not do anything for anyone, i should sacrifice myself for others, go work and be helpful maybe not like ghandi or mother teresa but a similar kind of helpful. i am not going to live for myself i do not want a familyhusbandwife, kids, partners and friendsi have to live for othersthe general society, someone has to why i hate myselfmy monolog is not structured, i jumped from one thought to anotherit is long and probably not worth your time but here it goes i hate how empty i am, how i always say the wrong things and always care about the wrong people. i have managed to make people hate me who actually liked me in the beginning. there is no such thing in me that i would call the self, i do not even have a persona social mask. i am not a person, just a vessel filled with contradicting emotions i am empty, without an identity even tho i have searched for it my whole teenage life. i never had ambitions nor future plans besides killing myself when i am 18 in my dreams i did have ideas for the future but i saw them as unreachable and gaved them up, leaving them in my head instead of making them reality . well technically i am dead inside now. i cannot cry or shout at someone else but i was always the one who was shouted at they were right i am a piece of shit i am not going to lie and pretend otherwise but it still hurts because i am trying to be good but always do something wrong,i am so fucking stupid and pathetic, i am a bad person naturally and suck at even being a decent person. i felt so guilty because of my behaviour that i did not went to school for about 6 months, made a lot of trouble etc. and all that just so i could punish myself and provoke myself to finally attempt suicide. obviously no one knows that and they also do not care. you know what is also fucking gross about me,its going to be embarrassing but in my teenage years 121617 i was unhealthy obsessed with love. i am not a person that has a lot of crushes, i have had just a few, three to be more specific. i hate myself for that but my obsessive behaviour was disgusting and embarrassing. basically i always had a long crush on someone, the longest was for about three years. instead of doing what most do, going to your crush after idk one month asking them out or befriending them, i stalked them on social media etc. which seems fine to most, but i also tried to meet this person in town and purposefully went where i thought they might be. next to that i was in a delsuion that this person will rescue me. you see shit like that in skins as example where the infamous effy had two guys trying to help her and rescue her. i was not inspired by movies or shows, its more like that this unhealthy attachment stamps from everyone hating or ignoring me, that is why i assumed that this person could save me from my normal life. this particular person was the only one who cared even tho i was not friends with them. heck, my friends cared less about me than this person who seemed genuinely concerned about me. i did not like the person at first and did not even bother to be friendly with them but after seeing how they cared i could not resist and developed feelings, i started to crave for this persons attention and love. i was and partly still am to some extend obsessed with my emotions which made makes me behave like an narcissist maybe i am one. my emotions ruled my life, nothing mattered but this person, because in my eyes i loved them, this love filled the void that my self hatred created. i wanted so badly that they rescue me from this life. that is where my obsession came from. i hate my personality, and i also happened to be ugly and dumb lol such a waste of air. yes i am a plain jane, i hope i will look better, because even tho i am empty inside, but if my vessel ever becomes pretty than people will not annoy menegative harrassment like bullying anymore. and the dumb part is self explanatory. there is a lot more but i am way too lazy to write that down now, i will edit this post if something new comes to my mind.btw . i am so sorry for my english, i am not a native speakeredit typos i hate myself",Depression

13245,"over 12 years ago, i m had bad anxiety with random panic attacks. depression was mixed in there as well probably due to the anxiety, they went hand in hand. i went to therapy and a psychiatrist. i was put on lexapro and the panc attacks stopped. i have since moved far away from those doctors, have not been to therapy in years. i just kept taking lexapro from my primary because why not. no one ever said to stop. but in the past year or two, my concentration has been getting worse and i felt other random little physical side effects from the medicine had just become annoying and thought why not stop lexapro, it is been years. i had to stop taking it before at one point due to moving and finding new doctor so i knew about withdrawals and i had to stop another couole prescriptions before lexapro was the one. i slowly lowered my dose every week or two for about a month or so. eventually, i stopped and of course physical withdrawals came on, brain zaps and all. i stopped 4 weeks ago and the zaps stopped about a week ago. i have been less tired in the mornings which was a big struggle on lexapro, always tired. i have been overall feeling myself. but i am still having some mental things. i am still finding myself having random moments of depression. just feeling hopelessness and thinking about the things i enjoy as a waste of time. i try to just work through it and tell myself it is temporary, thinking it could be the medication adjustment. the other weird thing is since i stopped the lexapro, i have had odd sexual side effects. like decreased sensation, weaker orgasm, not lasting as long, etc. i have never had this on lexapro, only one i stopped completely. this is starting to bother me and i am thinking there is some permanent problem from 10 years of lexapro.my main thing is, what do i do now? is this still normal adjustments from coming off lexapro or an ssri in general? i am not having panic attacks or bad anxiety which is why i took it years ago in the first place. do i talk to a primary first? should i try therapy? go back on medication? or go to a psychiatrist first? the problem is i have really crap insurance that only covers psychiatry and therapy through md live and i see mixed reviews on that so i keep getting put off from trying it. also, not sure if a therapist or psyciatrist is who i should talk to about this.maybe someone out here went through something similar. i feel like i started with anxiety years ago and ended up with new problems and depression. not sure what to do next",Depression

14537,"good morning!i have a question regarding medication here in germany. i am in psychotherapy for over a year now with a wonderful psychologist, the thing is, my psychologist lives in crete, greece due to the fact that my partner is greek and it is nearly impossible here in germany to get a psychologist if you are normal insuranced. in germany there are two types of health insurances, based on the field you work in. privately insuranced people are usually higher income. the majority of people are health insuranced as required by law, which usually covers everything, but to get an appointment for specialized doctors, not only talking about psychiatrists, but also talking about doctors like dermatologists, it is a huge advantage to be privately insuranced , because most doctors either only accept privately insuranced patients, because they bring in more money, or do not accept anymore patients at all. now to me. i am a 30 year old male who struggles with mental health issues since i was 19. i always coped with them by myself, because i was gay who was not out yet and because of that always single. that changed when i was 24, when i came out and i thought now my life would change, which it did first. when i met my current partner 5 years ago, i was over the moon. life was good, i had a good job that made me happy, money was stable, i was in love. after 6 months, my problems started. i always had a social phobia, but not in like being afraid about other people, i have never had problems with others. more like going outside, meaning agoraphobia. i always coped with it by myself and after some time my symptoms all related to my stomach nausea, stomach pain, diarrhea, or in general the urge to go to the toilet immediately as soon as i have to go somewhere would get better. but when it got worse when i was together with my partner, it did not get better ever since. i talked to him when it started april 2017 what my issue was and he was, and still is, very understanding, all in all a great man. but life happens. he also had some problems at work, and i really try to support him, but i am not always able to do that because of my agoraphobia, because to relax he just loves to go outside or travel, which i cannot do. and i am noticing, that this is affecting him as well. after some time, maybe after 2 years, he encouraged me to look for a psychotherapist. i do not know how it works elsewhere, but here in germany a psychotherapist is not allowed to medicate you if necessary, for that you need a psychiatrist. so i looked for one. i found two here jn germany, but with both them, i did not really get along with them and i did not feel comfortable with them. and then i found my current psychotherapist, who lives in greece, we have appointments over the internet once a week and we facetime. she is really wonderful and diagnosed me with depressions and suggested to look for a psychiatrist to talk about medications. and that is where the problems start. it is basically impossible for me to find one , because they either only take in privately insuraned patients which i am not or do not accept any patients at all. and i notice that my partner is slipping away. he coped with me for 5 years now and was so patient, but i think his patience is getting to an end. which i understand. he gave up so much for me the last few years not travelling , which makes him happy , and also struggles with his own problems, and he cannot really do anything good for him, because he just wants to travel with me, or at least just go out somewhere, which he cannot with me. i try, but as soon as the day comes when we planned something, i feel sick, basically run in the bathroom every five minutes. and it shows. i really try to not let him see that, because i want to make him happy, but of course he notices and at the end we end up not going somewhere or we do not go out at all. i manage now to go out a little bit there is a caf right next to our place and there is a park nearby where we hang out but we only do these two things, and it is boring him, which i understand. because he just wants to do stuff. and it hurts me to see that he is in pain because of me, because i also affects him mentally. he also goes out with his friends, but he just really want to do other stuff with me too, for which i love him , because he just wants me to feel better. and it would devastate me to see him suffer more. or worse, if he would leave me. which i would i kind of understand though.so, dear readers, has anybody any suggestions? or people from germany, do you have any idea how to get an appointment at a psychiatrist, in hope that a medication would help me? thank you! in search of a psychiatrist in germany",Depression

39592,idk if i need to but putting a big fat trigger warning here for ed general bad thought and pedophilia a well a the fact that this is basically a long post complaining about everything wrong with my life lol i don t see the point of trying to tell myself that it ll get better when i know that the next few month will be so much worse than now i don t have any reason to try to keep myself from ending it when my body is already dying much quicker then i d like and i don t have the motivation or the purpose to tell anyone how bad everything s gotten cant forget the fact i am autistic trans gay and basically everything else that i won t ever get accepted or treated right for lol i don t hate myself i don t even see myself a a person i know i have delusion about myself that i don t feel comfortable sharing even though i m comfortable sharing literally every other problem i have but i hate that i wa born in general i don t think i should have been born at all especially since i wa born a fucking girl being trans is the worst fucking thing to come out of being alive i would give every failing organ in my body just to have been born a man i can t come out to anyone in person i wouldn t be accepted by the majority of people i know anyway because i won t ever be taken seriously a a man no one regardless of who i meet will ever see me a a real man and that hurt more than anything people might start using he him when they feel like doing so but since they ll still see me a a girl anyways i don t see the point sometimes i think of growing my hair back out throwing on a dress and pretending that i m comfortable with being a girl because part of me think that i could come to live with it in time sometimes i consider finding someone twice my age online just to give me fake validation because it ll be much more than i ll ever get in person i know it not healthy but neither am i i want the worst for myself because it ll make me feel temporarily better since we re already practically trauma dumping might a well mention that i ve been targeted by older men my whole life since i wa i ve been flirted with proposed to and had weird sexual comment thrown at me by adult all whilst my very own mother would watch and laugh never thinking to tell them to stop i mean she s never been any better considering that she is by far the one person who s made my life the worst it can be but i live with her and will do for at least the next few year so it s not like i can do anything about it i m only who know maybe this shit is normal and i should just suck it up and deal with it i could go into depth about how my mother ha fuelled my body issue and my eating disorder s how she s blatantly ignored the sign of autism i displayed from birth and now make fun of me get angry at me for and let me get severely underweight at a very young age because i couldn t handle any food texture and still put it down to me just being picky having an eating disorder might actually kill me before i kill myself haven t lost any weight from it but have basically lost everything else my heart is faring the worst it s absolutely terrifying feeling it malfunction but for some reason i can t tell anyone how bad it s actually gotten i go to the doctor occasionally and they know there s at least thing wrong with my heart but they don t take it seriously unless i experience symptom which i do severely at that but i haven t told anyone and now i have to face the consequence for it s been getting so much worse in the last few month granted i haven t had another almost heart attack since middle of last year i had every heart attack symptom at once i broke out into a cold sweat in my bathroom and felt the worst anxiety i ve ever felt my vision started to go static and fade i wa practically holding onto my heart and i ve never felt so much like i wa going to die not even after i overdosed but i ve watched my heart rate drop to 0 on multiple occasion and seen it go way above 0 after just walking up some stair most night i sleep le than hour because every time i ve tried to sleep ive been worried that my heart will just give out and i won t wake up for some reason i can stomach killing myself but i can t handle not dying from my own hand i don t know what i want out of this empty reassurance someone to tell me i m not being unreasonable maybe i just want people to relate i think more than anything though i just want someone to talk to not even about the bad shit just someone to engage with and tell about my hyperfixations someone who won t just ignore me and most of all i want a friend i don t think i ll get that here i don t expect to nor do i really think it s fair i don t want to live anymore and i know that if i reach i ll end up ruining my life one way or another i don t care what happens to me anymore because it ll just get worse anyway if you ve read this far sorry for wasting your time drink some water or smth tldr im suffering

7550,"i have been reflecting on my life a lot lately, and i always find myself going back and thinking about the bullying i have dealt with through my life. hopefully sharing my story here can get some outside perspectives and give me an idea on how to move on.so a little about myself, i am a introverted guy whose hobbies fall in video games, anime and music. i have been playing video games since i was 3 and they have been my major escape for most of my life. i grew up in a small rural town for most of my life from when i was born to my senior year, am currently 25 and was actually a pretty optimistic kid in my youth, freespirited and just looking to have fun and make people smile. my parents have been pretty decent, but they were never around to support me so i mostly just stayed in my room playing games. it was around the age of 4 the i first experienced any sort of bullying. a couple of my older cousins would pick on me for some of the games i played. i was a playstation kid growing and they were nintendo kids and around 89 at the time this was happening unfortunately nobody really stepped in to stop them but things never went beyond verbal insults.this went on till i was about 89 myself and they grew up enough to stop it and we get along on the rare occasions i see them. elementary school was pretty uneventful as i mostly just kept to myself. middle school was where things took a turn for the worse.in my 5th grade gym class we had to start changing into gym clothes and i never got the memo that boxers were even a thing and was still wearing briefs at this point. we were all getting changed and i realized what was up, got really nervous because i noticed everyone else was wearing clothes that i did not even know existed and went into the one stall in the locker room to change, needless to say the locker room was full of boys making fun of the fact that i was wearing briefs. it was at this point most of the male classmates in my class and the grade above me started just verbally making fun of me, and the female students would either just do nothing or tell me to not make eye contact with them.by the time i got to my 6th grade, i only had a few friends and most of them were not actually friends with me and ended doing some things to me. i was getting no support from family or teachers and was started to feel isolated, so i tried to fake being cool, which did not really do anything in the long run. it was also this year where i saw another student in my grade wearing sweat pants to school, and since i had some figured i could wear some. i remember walking into class and a few classmates giggled a bit amongst themselves. i went to use the bathroom at some point in the day and on my way back was stopped by a female bully, who proceeded to call me gay and saying wearing sweat pants is for girls and other verbal insults. this was the only time i ever cried in school for something like this.i feel like i had to grow up really quickly emotionally in school due to a mixture of all this bullying and teachers would also make me hang out with special needs students, even if i did not want to. in 7th grade i had a crush on another girl in my class she was one of the only people in my class, let alone the school that actually treated me like an equal person and some of my friends physically dragged me over to her after i let them know that i had a crush on her and made me grope her breast, all the while i was begging them not to. thankfully she did not hate me for this8th grade was the first time i can remember wanting to die, not exactly wanting to commit suicide but wishing i could just cease to exist. i started to become really jaded, i could not trust anyone save for a few friends that i barely saw because i was too busy still trying to live this cool facade externally but just feeling so angry inside. being exposed to all these people hating and belittling me made me start loathing myself too. near the end of the year, the same group of friends from earlier pressured me into smoking some cigarettes that they managed to find. i do not even remember where i took one whiff, and in the back of my head i just said that is it, i am done with these guys, this is not what i want to bei left that school with one friend that i had just made that year, social anxiety and selfhatred from all the harassment. i remember that summer feeling really lonely, like i was just existing but i lost a lot of my drive and happiness.high school was better at least, there was still bullying, nothing compared to my old school but i think some people could sense my insecurities and would pressure me into saying or doing things, i tried to own this one man wolf pack loner sort of shtick but deep down i just wanted to be accepted. things ended completely by junior year but by that point the damage was done.nowadays i have a small group of friends who seem to like me for who i am. i still deal with the insecurities and fears from all those years ago and feel really emotionally stunted, like there is still this scared kid trapped in the body of this cold, logical body.for those who took the time, thank you so much for reading all of this, any advice on what i can do to move past my fears and insecurities are appreciated. hopefully i did not come off as too whiny. looking to share my

19956,"hello everyone, i just turned 22 years old and i feel like worthless peace of shit. through a lot of time i feel great about myself, i can stay really positive, but at times facing parents criticism for living in hothouse environment makes my emotions so high that i want just disappear and only then i started to see my negatives and realising how much more work i need to do. i feel worthless becouse i am really good looking guy, i used to approach about 30 females in one year confidentiality but nothing of it worked. i feel like if i would chase them i will never have the one i deserved and my life going to be miserable. i read 28 books in year although in my whole lifetime i read only few. i really try as much as possible to push me through this situation but everytime i do i fail. i want to study psychology becouse for few years i used to suffered anxiety attacks, besides that i probably need to pass some exams from high school which makes me not believe in myself becouse my past results were not the best since i did not used enough efforts to learn i thought i will play sports professional. i also failed 6 times on my driving exams which also made me believe that i am not capable of anything, i drive pretty good, but then exams come i cannot cope with stress and feeling exhausted. i do not really know how i keep pushing myself still trying after that much failing, i do not know how i keep that up. suddenly, i understood how fast time goes and i start doing everything to improve myself, i became really desperate with a mindset now or never. my biggest fear is not to have a girlfriend i want in terms of looks and not having a private house. i really know it is possible to achieve it for me but i do not know how, how to cope with negative thoughts that you will fail again, how to remove fair of rejection and how to be very independent, since my parents are very controling so it is hard for me to do independent choises alone. i understood that if i will define my passion in psychology i can be really successful and dedicate all the time to it, but i still need come long way becouse it is now my life and i am fully responsible of myself. i do not blame anybody for the concequences happened to me. i took all my responsibility for myself. i want to say to others i did not gave up then it was hard so you too will not give up for me. i feel like i am not living and just existing becouse everytime i fail and something i gave up for couple of months and tough myself as biggest failure in the world. i understand that i need to get a lot more rejections from jobs interviews and people to beat the fear of rejection. i feel really stuck that i cannot achieve some pretty easy goals for longer time then others. i know and feel that now is the time to rise above and achieve my dreams, overwise i will live with regret for rest of my life, i even regret things i did not do earlier like searching for my passion and wasting time with snowflake friends which were friends for me just for their needs. in addition, i want to begin trading stocks, but my parents said it is risky and i am afraid to doing it. i really hope someone experienced some alike situation and if not alike tell me how i can get through this everyday anxiety and achieve my goals, the only good thing i guess that i still have plenty of time,i really try hard sometimes, but maybe it is not enough, it is hard to live with constant pressure and self guilt everyday of not being who you truly could be. i also hit gym and was fit as never before but then covid began i gave myself excuses and quit gym. thank you in advance. i told my parents that i will go to work my first job at grocery store just to get a work experience and bit of independence. i need your advice guys",Suicidal

7445,"as the title says, i have been going bald for the past few years and it is made my life a living hell without a shred of hope. it is started when i was around 16.517 24 now and basically my life had stopped ever since. i need to mention i am using the common medications for hair loss, and though i have had nice results for some time, my hair is now at its worst state ever and it is only getting worse.i am so lonley, have no social life since i am ashamed to go outside, have never been loved by someone or even got intimate with a woman, and it is all because of this malicious curse. i would trade absolutely everything i have to have a normal head of hair, like a guy my age should have. i would give everything for the privilege of leaving my room without being ancious about my appearance. i know the hair is not my only problem, but it is most definitely the core of all the other ones.i was actually just at the hair transplant clinic as i am still trying to fight for my life, hopeful to make an appointment, and although the guy there said it is still too early for me does not mean it looks anywhere near decent he showed me my pictures from 5 years ago when i had last visited the clinic, and i looked so much better and had fantastic hair compared to what i have now. in fact, i was once a pretty handsome guy though never appreciated it, but the combination of depression and baldness have made me look old, sad and ugly to a point of no return.in that point of time it really does not matter whether i actually end my life or not, because i feel like i am already dead. actually, i do not even feel like i am human anymore, just a pathetic, useless piece of rubbish. having better days is actually the worst thing, because getting back to life after them only makes me feel much worse. my youth has been taken away from me and i feel doomed to be lonley and hating my appearance for the rest of my life.i have no idea what is the point of this post, but anyway, thank you for reading and have a nice rest of the week. going bald is slowly killing me",Suicidal

26832,"i finally went to see a psychotherapist after years of struggling and the conversation was really nice. i mean it was quite basic, he asked me if i wanted to talk freely or if he should ask away and i chose the latter, but still even just talking to someone who is nonjudgmental and not so reactive towards possibly disturbing things i might say was liberating. right at the start i told him i was suffering from depression, but after talking for just a bit he quickly crossed thatpossibility out, saying that i did not have the most prominent symptoms, being lack of sleep most importantly, among other things. apparantly sleeping well and too much is a disqualifier lol. in the end he did diagnose me with a reoccurent depressive disorder i dunno if that is the correct term in english on paper even though he said i am 'just' fatigued, so i am confused. however the main thing i wanted to say is that i just do not know how i feel about this if i count on his words and not the final diagnosis. i should feel relieved but if i am not depressed what makes me the mess i am? what makes me apathetic and hurt for no apparent reason? i cannot shoulder the responsibilty for 'failing' in life so far yet. it is too much without the 'excuse' of being depressed. to top it, this was my biggest fear ever since i suspected i might be depressed in my teenage years. that i might just be this way, that everything i was going through was just me, my personality. i finally embraced and accepted that i was depressed years along the way and often realized just how fucked up my mind is when others reacted strongly to random small things i said, seeing in what dark place my mind was. maybe i am just lazy and cannot grow the fuck up. i should have asked him if he was clearly diagnosing me with depression or what. or is there a difference i do not know about? he also said that i should meet with a specialist for gastroenterology for my iron deficiency and emphasized that many women apparently suffer from the kind of symptoms i do just from the deficiency. i have experienced severe anemia before and i have had barely acceptable iron stats for years, although i do take supplements whenever it dips too low and have that checked every year, which my doctor for that does not take it half as serious. anyway even though i came out confused i rode the high of having achieved seeking help, which i have been putting off for ages. and as i said before, just talking openly was really nice and i feel like i got lucky to actually like the first professional i met with, having heard that many need to switch a few times before finding someone they click with. even though i cannot go back there, as there are no capacities in my city for the demand there is apparently. please go seek therapy if you need it. everybody can benefit from it, not just us depressed folks. so yeah if anybody actually read this far, have a nice daynight, i wish you well. just me rambling about my experience in one first therapy session",Depression

10834,"i have only 1 person i can somewhat open to but i have only done so to a certain extent and try to refrain from doing it at all for the most part. i feel guilty as if i am bothering them with unfairly dumping my bullshit onto them and as if i am doing it for attention or pity. i honestly have no clue how long this will end up being. whether this story grosses you out, makes you hate me, or even if you choose not to read it, everything is fine with me. it does not really have a point. i just felt like id never actually let my thoughts out properly and so this is my trashbin.was raised in a single mother household and never knew my father. mother divorced him for being psychotic and threatening not only her life but the lives of his children as well. this was after years of her holding out believing it was her duty to sacrifice herself to let her children have a financially stable home with 2 parents. we ended up in a very low class town with minimal income but my mother worked herself to the bone with low paying jobs in an attempt to make sure we still had as good of a life as she could make. unfortunately i still ended up being a weird kid. not really sure why but i have always wondered if i had a disorder that was simply never noticed and properly diagnosed. i know now though that i have severe anxiety problems which were hereditary. she spent every last ounce of her strength just trying to provide for the family so she had very little left over to actually raise the children. once i got into the public elementary school my weirdness ended up with me never developing any connections. eventually there was severe bullying. i would never paid any attention to it till my most recent years when i started to reflect on why i am the way i am now, but i know that some of it definitely mentally changed me in very not good ways. though all these years i never thought of it as such. for what i believe was the reason above i ended up dropping out of the school system after at least a year of problems. the biggest was me refusing to go to school by faking epileptic seizures as a way to get out. i actually had epilepsy but all of the seizures i ever had at school were fake. the final nail in the coffin was 1 particularly violent bully beating the shit out of me and stomping my head into the concrete pavement for almost a minute like he was playing dance dance revolution at an arcade. teacher was too scared to physically stop him i guess? stayed out of the system for like 34 years while the public school shut down. we live in an extremely economically dead town. like the majority of the towns roughly 1000 population are under the 10k annually mark including us and barely survive solely off government benefits and the low cost of living. that was when i first started to seclude myself off. it was not terrible but at the same time i had no real social connections. i did things like go on occasional outings with family members and such but i had no friends or social groups at all. eventually i started to really dive into my playstation 2 and slowly started sticking there more and more as time went on. my grandparents both finally fell down ill due to old age. my grandmother developed parkinsons and my grandfather went through several bad falls as well as slowly developing dementia. this was an unbearably huge amount of stress on my mother who was already being torn apart by how hard she was struggling to keep the household up. eventually she decided to sacrifice her job in exchange for taking up the home healthcare position of taking care of my grandparents. with this she would work literally next door to us, be able to take care of her parents when no one else in the family would, and she would still make an income. it was shaky but things were still fine back then. around the age of 11 or so bad memory of things back then she decided to pay a heavy amount of money to put me back into school. there was a very small little private school in town that was run by an older gentleman named mr. g, 3 teachers, and maybe a total student body of 25 or so children in various grades split between those 3. 2 of them were very nice older women named miss d and then my teacher named miss n. i guess i had problems with anxiety but eventually i managed to be somewhat happy. unfortunately the third teacher, miss p who was the daughter of miss d, was a very difficult person. she had extreme anger issues, seemed to just dislike children as a whole, and had absolutely no patience for anyone who lacked. miss n was a much more elderly woman than the other 2 and at some point she became far too ill to continue her teaching job. the remaining kids were mostly moved to miss p's class with the only exceptions being the much younger children in the lower grades. every single day was a living hell for me. the simplest way to describe it is that she held extreme animosity towards the weaker kids. if you were falling behind in the pace of your work, or if you were not producing grades that she was happy with, or if you did not understand something, she just hated you. when you did something like this she would threaten you, scream at you, talk to you like she was about to physically beat the shit out of you, oftentimes not so subtly threatening to actually do so. she used intimidation like standing directly above you in your seat and silently glaring you down. it would be even worse when she would bend down and put herself right in your face and start with her threatening. or she would take a heavy book and slam it in front of you. there were at least 2 kids that definitely had learning problems, like a young little blonde boy named tyler. the poor kid would often be the last to finish his work, or maybe it was even a group of 3 of us. she would slam her hand down on her desk in the corner, look at us like she was about to kill us, and then tell us in the most threatening manner that she could muster get it down now. the school had a physical discipline policy that was based on parental permission. she would often take tyler somewhere to beat his ass with a belt when he was not performing like she wanted. the other method she used a lot was what i liken to a military shark attack. she would take the student to a separate part of the school, plop them down in a chair, and start shouting in their face. she berated them on why they cannot do what she wants them to do, why they cannot do it fast enough, why cannot you understand this or that when you should be able to understand it, and when some poor kid can only respond with i do not know she just lays on harder. she always told us that we can do it how she wants but we are just lazy or do not want to do it. or that our parents did not raise us properly.the principal, mr g, apparently knew about some of this but miss d did her best to protect her daughter. some of the parents would become aware of this and many different students over the years would get taken out because they could not handle miss p. miss d was honestly a nice and good hearted person but i guess she simply loved her daughter and did not want to see her fired. i still do not know to this day how the school had not been hit with any legal problems but maybe what she was doing was not considered abuse or anything.eventually history repeated itself and i continued to miss more and more school. i would wake up hours before it was time to leave for school because i was terrified of going and could not sleep. a lot of times i would cry on the way there and beg my mother to not force me to go. i think i had a hard time explaining to her why i hated school so much. she knew the teacher was causing issues but was not sure of what to do. because she was soft she would let me skip school pretty often on days like that, but she was also pressed as she was paying the school a huge fee monthly for me to go, i was losing a lot of school work due to missing everything, and she was also legally pressed as there was a child law stating that you could not miss so many days of school. finally after so long of it she mentally could not handle juggling my problematic school life and her other responsibilities so she pulled me out. i was labeled as being homeschooled so we were legally safe but i never touched a single bit of homeschooling work at all. same situation as before. i had not managed to build any relationships with people and had no connections to social groups. i went back to my little room and continued to play video games. as the years went by i became more and more secluded and slowly degenerated as a person. stopped interacting with even my family members, stopped leaving the house for days at a time, stopped interacting with my mother, stopped interacting with the house, ect. then came things like neglecting my basic hygiene, neglecting my responsibility to assist with the household, ect. i am not worried about revealing this as i can remain anonymous but i believe my hygiene and standard of living was probably far below what most people could imagine. at the worst points of it i could have gone a month or over without bathing and years without brushing my teeth. my room had become a literal vile trash heap filled with soda cans, junk, dishes, and rotting food. how i never contracted some horrific disease is beyond me, and somehow i came out with a perfectly healthy set of teeth despite horrible yellowing. through it all my mother destroyed herself trying to deal with me as a life sucking parasite living in the back of her house and her slowly dying parents that were succumbing to old age and terrible illnesses. i sat by staring at my computer screen, having basically no human interaction with anyone and even amongst online groups still being a weirdo that never got along with people, not paying attention to both her and the house falling apart. even in my little computer world i was not satisfied though. i still do not understand a lot about myself but i believe i sought out video games as a form of fulfillment as i have nothing else. i looked towards competitive games or extremely grind heavy games as a way of feeling like i could accomplish something and feel like i had worth. unfortunately i quickly learned that i was pretty mediocre at these things as well. even if i could happily play a game 10, 12, 14 hours a day i still could not succeed how others could. i started to learn very quickly that regardless of what i dived into i was also lacking. i believe this led to my complex of believing that i am incapable of doing anything at all. somewhere at around the age of 18 i got some awareness and finally realized where i would gone. spent all of those years thinking no way i could end up like this. that is impossible. and then suddenly i open my eyes and i am already there. seen my husk of a mother dealing with a dysfunctional family, both from her children and her siblings. seeing everything i would loved as a child decayed and gone. i had a cousin named jeff and his father named sammy who i loved more than anyone else when i was a kid. when i was much younger jeff died after a life fighting against cancer which left his father and mother broken. instead of trying to connect with my uncle which could have done us both good i instead spent my time shutting myself off from my family, and eventually he also passed away from a broken heart and crippling illness. i cannot tell you how much i regret that. in 2017 my grandfather finally passed away from his problems, and then about 1 year later my grandmother followed after him. that was the end of my mothers employment and thus any income we had. her mental state was destroyed by the years of stress and then the loss of her parents, and she was already in her 50's on top of being physically worn out so even if she wanted to try she was no longer fit for work. i was a pile of shit with mental issues who could not even interact with people properly anymore much less join the workforce. what little education i started out with had been completely forgotten and i forget how to even write. i can still write letters but there is almost no way i could handle anything past a few simple words. i only relearned how to write my name in cursive because i had to start filling out my own paperwork in hospitals and such. i never actually remembered or possibly even learned how to use proper grammar and punctuation. what i am doing now is only from me copying what i see other people do and trying to figure out how it is used from there. i have tried self learning things in the past but i get overwhelmed and it feels like i cannot grasp anything no matter what i try. we spent the next several years in financial hell. begging friends and family for money where we can just to keep utilities and internet on, of course using government programs for things like food stamps. there were plenty of times where we would lose electricity or water anyway as there is a limit to begging and what others can do to help you when they are struggling with their own lives. our relatives in texas were a bit more successful and it was in large part thanks to them that we even managed at some points. even still we have had situations where we lived without water for months before, electricity for weeks, ect. we also managed to rack up a utility debt to the town which is where we would lose the water a lot. it was due to an error on their part where they failed to shut off our gas line and thus charged us for utilities we did not use. we were constantly hit by struggle after struggle but life continued on. somewhere along the way i developed a back disability. it could have been hereditary, it could have been a random occurrence, or it could have been a result of my terrible lifestyle. i do not know the answer. at first it was not anything major but it slowly progressed to be worse and worse as time went on. after so long we started to piece things back together through a few different methods. specifically we relied on a deposit that originally belonged to my grandparents but my family handed it over to us since we needed money the most. then my grandfather's precious car that had decayed away in his garage was also sold. this money at least helped us for a few months until we finally managed to get more government assistance and deal with the town. we managed to get a program that pays for our electricity and then got the town to ignore the debt of our water bill for the time being while we pay a small amount every month to keep it on. eventually though i started to crack. over the years i refused to swallow the notion of depression. i had lived my entire life by having my mother take care of me, sacrificing herself to deal with me even though she should not have. i had not changed my ways much but i started to develop a mentality that i did not deserve anything from anyone, especially not the right to be depressed. i would have moments where it would creep up on me, but i would throw it away and ignore it. however time went on and the guilt only piled up. i could not change my ways or do anything to change my life. i am nothing but a burden and i cannot change it. the fact that i would always revert back to my ways and the fact that years went by without any sort of change killed me so much. then one day about a year ago i watched a motivational video from an old man who started from a truly low position in life. he was a bright and strong old guy who tried to convince the younger generation that they can do it and that he understands that life is hard for people in these times, maybe even harder than it was in his. i watched a few of his videos and the only thing i could think was i am nothing like this person. i cannot be as strong as this person. i cannot change my life like this person. i am sorry for failing. that is when i first started hurting myself. was not anything major. was an old pocket knife and i did not aim deep. and you know? it felt good. not in a physical way of course. i would been taking so many painkillermuscle relaxer pills that i did not feel much. however i would always thought that i could not even commit suicide if i wanted to because i would be too weak to even endure the pain or have the guts enough to because it. but those few cuts proved me wrong. i could do it and it was pretty easy, and that made me happy. for about a week i would continue making cuts here and there just to continue reaffirming that feeling of accomplishment. i just passed the cuts off as my huge cat losing his marbles and attacking my arm. since i would never really interacted with my mother much and never allowed myself to show any sort of symptoms of depression she did not even begin to suspect anything else. but then an argument happened. it was something stupidly simple. i had a pack of meat that i wanted to take out of the freezer to defrost, but it was 2 separate packs joined in the middle by tough plastic. i could not separate it and lazily threw the entire thing into the fridge to defrost. my mother stopped me and proceeded to lecture me about how i always waste so much food and i got annoyed. i just grabbed the meat and was going to chuck it back into the freezer for another time but then she got pissed at that as well and jerked it out from in front of me and started telling me how i am always so childish, impatient, lazy, and i am beginning to think that you will never change. this one little line broke something. i thought to myself she also understands that i am worthless and that i will never change or become better. it was like i knew that she knew the entire time but hearing it and thus confirming it is an entirely different thing for me. even though i of course knew that is not what she meant i could not help but think about these things. i quietly slinked off into my room like i normally do but once i was behind a closed door and was not being bothered i silently broke down. i cried, i laughed at myself, and then i started cutting more. this time was harder. i was angry at myself with how fucking pathetic and disgusting and how much of a soul sucking worm i was. after a few larger cuts than normal i really broke down and finally started going for real deep wounds.then i looked out of the corner of my eye and noticed an old fish fillet knife on my desk. i enjoy knives as a hobby so i had a lot of different stuff scattered around my room. i took it, thought about what sort of damage i could deal with it, and i was happy at the thought. to avoid explicit details i ended up with 4 deep gashes. i was not sure if i was necessarily thinking of committing suicide with that or not. i almost wanted it but i also avoided cutting directly on the wrist and also remained aware the entire time that i knew a better method to ensure it would work if i committed to it. i did not feel much of anything, maybe not even the slightest burn. could have been adrenaline, could have been the pain meds, could have been both. however as i sat there for a while breaking down further and further while i continued to bleed badly the thought crossed my mind that i could have actually done potentially fatal damage. i never really had a plan to begin with for hiding such massive cuts but they were far beyond the point of just wrapping them up and pretending it was nothing. that is when my legs gave out, my vision blurred, i became ultra light headed, and my arms and hands became extremely numb while tingling super hard. id suddenly got scared and thought that i might have killed myself somehow. i stumbled to the front of the house and showed my mother what happened. told her i loved her and was sorry for failing her and then just sat down on the kitchen floor and just kind of blurred out from there. a nearby off duty emt rushed over and took a look. nothing fatal as the knife had been dulled over the years without me knowing but stitches were definitely needed so she patched me up as best as she could and i was rushed to a hospital in a far off city. closest city could not accept me due to covid or something so i ended up going to a larger but further away city. mother cried so much on the way there and she was absolutely traumatized. ended up saying goodbye to her at the hospital entrance and then sat in a holding cell for what was probably about 34 hours. went through the process of getting patched up and once day break hit i got shipped off to a mental facility nearby. i spent about a week there. i had more human interaction in that 1 week than i had in the entire 10 years leading up to that point, and most of it was me silently sitting in the corner. despite that though the facility was not worth anything at all and i am still not sure how people are cured there. maybe it was a holding facility and not an actual hospital but i do not know and never cared to know. it was just a depressing common room where everyone just sat around in uncomfortable chairs, drank decaffeinated coffee, and tried their best to sleep through the day until they were allowed to go back to their rooms for the night. met some interesting characters. the people in there ranged from people with major disorders, to people in drug remission, people coming off an alcohol trip, and even something like anger problems. got to meet a gorgeous young hood girl named audrey who i instantly developed a crush on and also got to experience what it was like having a roommate even if i absolutely hated it. was picked up by my mother and uncle after my week was up and really had not received any sort of help or counseling. id felt like an entirely different person though just finally being around people and even briefly opening up about myself to a few people around me. had some sort of psychiatrist call center try to help me afterwards but all it amounted to was a group of random people who i formed no connection to calling me up whenever they felt like it to ask me if i was ok and if i needed any more meds. i was probably at fault since id already had a hard time opening up but i felt even less inclined when it was someone i did not care about or know over the phone. suddenly for a short bit i had family members swarming around and feeling like they had to somehow help me. was given my first cellphone as i had not ever needed nor wanted one previously, and not but maybe a few weeks later my cousin contacted me to tell me he wanted me to work a part time job. its really low hours which works in my favor with my disability and its a simple cleaning job so i can pick it up so easily. i thought of this as a first step that would hopefully give me a mentality that i can do better and i can be of use to people. the money is next to nothing but for the first time in years we do not have to ask someone for assistance the moment we need even the smallest of things. can keep basic household items around, keep my pets fed, try to keep bills paid, ect. after about 2 or so months i turned towards fixing my back. if my legs recover from the severe muscle pains i experience when walking then i could hold a full time job with good pay and from there its just a slow process of building myself up. the ineptitude i feel, the lack of education that haunts me, the disability that holds me back, all of it could be fixed with some time. i felt so happy and it was such a new feeling that i had not felt in so long. that is when everything quickly came caving in. so far my doctors and related medical procedures were all moving at a crawl. i spent several years dealing with a doctor that had to be demanded to move through several visits before they would actually do something, and i repeatedly kept getting thrown back and forth between tests and random crap. i ended up in physical therapy several times but that never amounted to much because apparently government health insurance does not afford particularly quality or motivated therapy sessions. that went nowhere fast and so id spent the years up until that point just hopped up on a high dose of painkillermuscle relaxers. however all of a sudden everything sped up real damn quick. there was immediate discussion about consulting a neurosurgeon which we spent a while trying to find due to not only the limitations on what the state had available but also what we could find with our insurance. dumb doctor seemed optimistic and told me it should be easily treatable. finally got to meet my neurosurgeon for the first time and he was even more optimistic. he spun a tale of how so damn easy and quick it would be to fix a busted disc and that even if the back pain was not 100 cured there was no way he could not fix it up so that my legs were not fine again. said everything was a guaranteed easy operation. so on my very first consultation due to my naivety and stupidly thinking i could trust doctors i agreed to a surgery. short version of that is several shady things happened with that doctor and after about a month or 2 of recovery i could safely say that not only had the surgery failed but i was not at least 2 or 3 times worse off than i was previously. now that were later into 2021 i have been told after a follow up visit that the disc is no longer salvageable and the damage may yet get worse as there are signs that more discs will degrade and blow out in the future. a surgery to potentially stop the problem from worsening has been suggested but all of his previous enthusiasm is gone and he believes there is a good chance the rest of my discs will go bad regardless of what happens. for now i am taking more pain meds than before just trying to keep my little job together but who knows when that will start to fail as well. in that time span of my cutting incident to now i rose up higher than id been in years only to fall lower than id ever been before mentally. things like my hygiene have gotten to acceptable levels. i still have anxiety about so many things that eat away at me on a daily basis but i have gotten better at talking to people even if i cannot manage to build social connections. but i have completely lost hope of ever escaping poverty, ever having a body that is not too weak to do what i want, trying to build a normal social life and make up for all those years i wasted, or even escaping from behind my little computer screen. any time i try to think about it, or when someone tells me what i should be doing, somewhere along in that plan that i am cooking up i reach a roadblock that stems from something of these 3 issues. i have come to hate everything about myself and where i am at now. even if i try to explain it away i still blame myself for ending up like this. suicide seems to be the only thing i can think about now as i have lost all form of motivation to even do the things that i once enjoyed. i am simply trying to pass through each day until hopefully i hit another emotional breakdown that will give me the push i want to overcome everything else and just end it. rather than wasting my time and spending my entire life self loathing and living like this i decided that if nothing changes by the time i am 25 in 2 more years ill resolve myself to end it if i do not do it sooner. venting and dumping my story here if that is fine. it is ok if it needs to be removed for whatever reason.",Suicidal

23867,"i have struggled with some anxiety for a few years now. i had symptoms of anxiety as a child that were not too obvious but now that i am older and reflect back i can see those symptoms should have been alarming. i had and still attachment issues. i would fear being left home alone when i was 9 parents could not afford babysitter and would often just spend that time crying. one of my elementary school teachers even told my parents i was not ok and should seek a therapist but they did not really listen. i had a hair pulling disorder i know what its called but cannot spell it and overall i was always an over thinker but at the time i did not know that was anxiety. i did get the hair pulling checked out when i was 1011 but that doctor was completely useless, all they prescribed was a serum for my scalp to get the hair to grow back. like thinking back i am not a doctor or healthcare professional but if a kid is pulling their hair during moments of stress i would think mmmhn maybe let us send this kid to a therapist so they can learn how to cope not just here is a serum, good luck maybe if that doctor would have intervened right away my anxiety would have never gotten this bad. years later when i was 1516 i would get dizzy spells. and it was concerning to my parents so they took me to the doctor. same clinic but different doctor. all they said drink more water and i started doing that but my dizziness never went away. at that point i had given up on doctors. this clinic in my area is for the lower income on medical and is known to be very careless. my parents however are not english speakers so how would they know, their mentality was well a doctor said she is fine so that is thatthen when i was 17 almost 18 i had my first panic attack. i do not remember much but i remember my mom being really scared cuz she did not know what was happening. and ever since then i have not been ok. i am 22 almost 23 now and its only getting worse. i have had bad insomnia this past month to where i flat out just quit my job because i was working early morning shifts. retail job i am still in school so i can go a bit not working i have never had issues sleeping either so this is new. so now that i am very sleep deprived i feel super depressed. i feel like i cannot take it anymore and i am never going to get better. recently i just met a friend a year ago that has been wonderful and my biggest support system. i do not know if i believe in signs but he came into my life at the right time because if it were not for him i do not know how much more of this i could handle. i know i have him to talk to but sometimes i feel like i am too much and i do not want to overwhelm him.because of the no sleeping causing my mental health to worsen, i do not know how much more i can handle. its to a point where i have been considering ending it but i do not know. i need help, i am hoping to see a therapist tomorrow at a walk in clinic but i know that is going to take a while to help me. and i want relief now. this was my way of ranting, idk i need help tho. i do not know how much more i can handle",Depression

12569,"i am struggling a lot with my life at the moment. i am 24 and basically just feel very lost making no progress. i also feel like there is a lot wrong with me, this post will be a ramble.i feel as though my career is moving very slowly. i have a degree, but it is essentially worthless as it is a mediocre grade, and not in a specific area. my current job does not pay very well, and you do not need qualifications to get the position i am currently in. i have tried and failed to get a better paying job, i cannot help but feel that i would have been much better off working straight after finishing school at 16 and working my way up somewhere rather than going to university. some of my peers have done this and are in a much better place in terms of earnings, house ownership, car etc. than me. i decided to start studying for an extra qualification in my spare time to boost my earnings potential. while i think that this was most likely a good decision, it does feel as though it is not going to get me where i need to be on its own, maybe upping my salary potential by around 5k. it is costing me around 2000 to do, and now that i have been doing it a few months the initial novelty has worn off and it is starting to drain me having to do extra studying after a full day's work, especially with the knowledge that i will most likely have to study a higher qualification on top after completing this one to achieve a decent salary anyway. i have no idea what i want to do in life and never have, i have just taken a route in something that i know i can do easily, and am taking the natural steps to progress. but the whole time i cannot help but feel like i will never find something that i ever really want to do, the only reason i am doing any of this is to earn more money, and the things i am doing are not even a guarantee of that anyway.currently i live at home with my parents. i am saving up every month for a deposit for a house as i would much rather do that than rent, but the cost of housing is just going up and up, and the salary required to afford a property mortgage is way above what i am earning. the older i get the more desperate i am getting to move out but it seriously just feels as though it is getting further away rather than closer. i feel like i am just in a hamster wheel and not getting any closer to any of these goals. i do not mind my parents, they are not terrible and living at home does have its benefits, but i am closer to 25 than i am to my 24th birthday now and at this point i am fed up and need my own space. but it just feels as though it is so far away, and even when i try and break it down it just feels like such an impossible task.mentally i am in a terrible place. i have been for a while, my self esteem is awful, i am really struggling with everything at the moment. i self harm, frequently have depressing thoughts and am just generally unhappy. i suspect i probably have some undiagnosed disorder, when i browse the symptoms of bpd it is like checking off a list. but the process of getting treatment therapy is incredibly long and expensive, and i honestly have no idea where to start. it is so expensive that i feel seeking out therapy when i have not really experienced anything traumatic enough for it just feels like a waste, and it is going to set back my other financial goals even more. on top of that i am trying to balance studying in my spare time and everything else, i just do not know how i would have the time.socially i barely have any friends. i would say i have 3 truly good friends, 2 of them live far away so seeing them on a regular basis is not easy, and again is expensive. i only have 1 friend that i can see without travelling at least 90 mins. there is a huge age gap with 90 of my work colleagues. a few months ago my girlfriend broke up with me, which to be honest completely broke me. that relationship was something i thought was truly going well in my life but at some point she decided otherwise, she had her reasons, shit happens. she made clear it was nothing i had done and was not my fault but it is really hard to accept that. i am a lot better now than i was 12 months after it happened but it still affects me every day. i have no idea how i am going to trust anyone in the future in terms of a relationship. i also feel as though i am in no state to even be in a relationship anyway having written all the above stuff down. but it is just another thing that gets to me, i feel quite lonely as it is, and she was really good to me and it was a loss of a good friend in a way too. i feel like i am doing something wrong in relationships, i have never had a true, multi year long term relationship. i have no idea what it is about me that is not good enough. i do not pour all my problems out like this to partners. sometimes it is discussed but i made a point to never burden my ex with all my problems like this. yet here i am alone anyway. i cannot help but feel there is just some negative aura that people sense and do not want to be around me anymore.after the above happened i tried so hard to get into new stuff. i started doing new hobbies, things that i had not done before. exercising more than ever before, all the usual things people tell you to do. and it just does not help. i have even been on holiday, which was a welcome distraction, but coming back home and back to reality it just feels as though my life is not going anywhere. the past few days i have just been so deflated. all my usual hobbies no longer interest me, i just have no desire to do anything that i normally do. i do not know enough people and i crave socialising, but if i try going to a club or something i just get so socially awkward anxious. i am desperately craving some excitement in my life, the only things that are appealing are drinking, which i am really trying to avoid at the moment as it just makes me feel so much worse afterwards. i get tempted by gambling, but even that stops interesting me, unless the amounts are high enough to be risky. but i know i do not have the disposable income to play around with that anyway.i am absolutely sick of social media, i hate it so much. i hate how fake everything is. i deleted the majority of my social media apps. i am completely fed up of the news, it feels like everything you read online is so negative and depressing. and on top of all that like everyone else i am sick to death of covid, that in itself just feels like one step forward, 2 steps back. the government in the uk constantly contradicts and goes back on their own advice. and yet i know even if covid was gone i would still be in the exact same spot i am now. i feel myself turning bitter and angry at everything which in turn would just make me even worse to be around. everything is just building up and i have no idea what to do about it, the best way i can describe is i feel like i am playing life on hard mode.yet there is nothing really wrong with me. ok maybe i am depressed? but i have no physical disabilities, i have no disease, i have not suffered anything traumatic, i do not have a broken family, i am not stupid, i have a job, i have some qualifications, i have a car, i have some friends. i know i have a lot of things that many people would be grateful for. and yet i cannot help but just feel so broken.if anyone's read

17027,"when i was barely over the age of one, cps took me away from my birth mom. needless to say, i was found in a terrible state. the very first family to take me in as a foster child, eventually they were able to adopt me when i was 3. sadly though, i was forced to continue my relationship with my mother throughout the years i was a foster child, which was ultimately detrimental in how i ended up. luckily it was a closed adoption, sadly though, the parents who had adopted me, had divorced a few years later. my mom got me and the other kids, while occasionally we would see our dad. though, my mother would rarely let me see my father. it was obvious from the start, i was different from other kids. i look back on it, and i realize just how much of a struggle i had to deal with. i attended special classes for my speech impediment, i was always getting bad grades and i just did not understand anything. instead of getting me help, my mother did not believe in medicine or doctors. i just recently found out that she knew i always had add, but never told me. she would ground me for not crying when someone i did not love, would die. i was always getting grounded and i was never allowed inside the house. no matter how hydrated i would get, she would not allow me inside, and she worked me like a slave. only ever cleaning when i was inside. eventually i ended up living with my dad and his new wife when i became a teen. i ended up getting caught having sex, and my father who was extremely strict, grounded me for years. i started getting treated like i was a dirty person, and that they would not feel comfortable allowing such a person around their kids. and to this day i am still treated like this. what more, i went back and forth between my mom and dad, eventually i was kicked out before i could graduate and have struggled ever since. i always struggled with depression, but as soon as i became an adult, i started truly feeling suicidal and depressed. i started coming out to my family, who i have always had a rocky relationship with, and was always shut down and told to stick it up. they ignored my pain and suffering, and i refused to ever ask help from any of them. but my sister would always have my back, she would make sure i would not be homeless. and now i just find myself in a rut. i am in the first relationship i have had for years and its terrible. he deceived me into believing he was someone else, and like an idiot, i feel for it. he is made us get into tremendous debt, and now i find myself the lowest i could ever be. i have no motivation and i know i just cannot keep doing it anymore. i am tired, and i do not care to live. i do not care what happens after this, i just want to be set free from this misery. i also cannot help but resent my father, he has so much money yet he refuses to help anyone. he says to work hard, even if it means work 247, since he is an alcoholic. but i just struggle so much, and the fact that he is out there spending ridiculous amounts of money on the dumbest of stuff, but not on helping out his child that is struggling so much, who finally admitted to him that i have been suicidal.i have come to realize that all the abuse i went through as a child, has damaged me in a way that i can never hope to be normal. i still have a speech impediment, but i have learned to become the silent character. i know that i have some form of autism, i have looked up all the signs and i have worked so hard to understand myself. i do not want to be here anymore, and i guess really, i just want to be heard. wanting permission to die",Depression

23982,"okay, so to start off, i am a pretty depressed individual. been mildly suicidal for many years and would rather be dead than live my life. i am aware that i have made my own mistakes in life.ampx200bthe root of my depression lies in the fact that i have a terminally ill dad. i also had severe cystic acne which left a ton of scars on my face, so you can guess how my social life is. before my cystic acne, i was actually an outgoing and friendly individual, but then after the horrible 10 years of cystic acne and now their scars, i have become an introverted jerk that does not even like people looking at him.ampx200bto top it all off, i was studying for jobs before the pandemic began, and now because of that, the exams have all been thrown off schedule for an entire year, and my prep has gone to shit. so i am also jobless.ampx200boh and yes, the aforementioned terminal illness that my father has? i also might possibly have it in the future because i took some tests and i have the factors within me.ampx200bso currently, since my dad is also off his job because of the illness, and i am jobless, my mom is the sole bread winner of our family. this alone puts so much of stress on me. most days, i feel like i cannot do shit because of the depression. i feel like all my efforts are in vain.ampx200bso you can see that i am not exactly a happy person. but all the reasons mentioned above are not why i have come to rant in here. no, that reason is my grandma.ampx200bi have three grandmas. sisters. the oldest of themthe current grandma in question, is just that, old. so she is kind of senile. she also cannot hear a thingwe have to literally shout in her ear to tell her something, and she forgets most of everything after some time. i do not even talk with her, i just nod or shake my head when she asks me something because she cannot hear a thing.ampx200bso first off, she cannot hear a thing, and then when she does hear a thing, she forgets it after a few minutes. so you can see how frustrating it is already, right? now, she is also convinced that her own sistersthe other two are thieves, so she is constantly cursing them when she is alone in her room. and since i am at home the whole day, i constantly hear her cursing. this constant cursing just gives me so much stress.ampx200bshe also has the pains that every old person gets, you know, in the joints, etc. she has intense pain in her left eye socket, for which btw we have taken her to several doctors and tho they have given us vitamins and whatnot, they have said that pain is mostly psychological. gran ofcourse, does not know any of this, so she constantly asks for medicine, constantly complains of the pain, constantly calls me again and again and again, either to ask for some medicinewhich i have given her like ten minutes ago or to tell me to call a doctor, or to complain how her legs or her eyes are paining.ampx200bat first, yes, it is pitiful and you feel sad when an old person complains of such pain, right? you do what you can to make that pain go away. but when this thing goes on for months and months and months. when you hear her constantly complaining, constantly cursing, constantly calling your name. how do you think it feels?ampx200blike absolute hell. that is what. and i love her. she is like a second mom to me, she practically raised. so i am in such a dilemma. i feel guilty the whole day because she asks for medicine, but when i say nobecause she is already taken them she starts cursing me too. calling me selfish, etc. it is makes my blood boil,because i have my own depression killing me on the inside and then there is her on the outside. i sometimes feel like slapping her, because her curses are so nasty. imagine loving someone but also feeling so angry that you just want to punch them in the face. what moral dilemma that puts you into. how guilty that makes you feel. and since i cannot go out because of my social insecurity thanks to a face full of horrible acne scars, i am at home all day. and she keeps calling only me. even if my whole family is there, she only calls me. over and over and over. to repeat the same questiondid i take my medicine. i know it is not her fault. that she cannot control it. but that even worse you know. because you can even blame them and yet they make you want to kill yourself. so please, any advice? what am i supposed to do? i feel like a jerk all day. like i am a nasty person.ampx200band what is more, because of dad's illness, he is also frustrated, right, and so he also behaves like a jerk towards everyonealways angry, short tempered, thinks only he is correct, etc so voila! another person who is angry at me and insults me all the time but i cannot do anything because he is sick. i have to understand.ampx200bbut who the fuck is going to understand me? who the fuck is going to understand that i also have depression? that i also feel angry. whenever i show my anger, the other members of my family guilt me by saying that i am supposed to understand, that those others that i am angry at, are sick, etc. i just wish i would never been born tbh. that i never existed. then i would not have had to face all these shitty situations. i never even asked to exist. to be born.ampx200bso please any input is appreciated. thank you. some advice please. because i am seriously losing itvhere",Depression

10743,"throwawayim female, 20 years old. ever since i was 12 i have been on antidepressants, antipsychotics for severe depression and anxiety. my parents are divorced since i was 2. they have both been in relationships after. i have lived with my mother and majority of my life its just been us two living together. my brother lived with my father. my mother was in a relationship when i was 11. we moved in with him. he abused her mentally and physically. i heard everything. i saw the scars. fast forward a few years later she dated another guy. i had met this guy before, we lived with him when i was around 7. it did not last. last year we got a call that he had hung himself. my father does not understand mental illness. he often calls me a baby or a child and tells me to just suck it up. that its all in my head. my one and only serious relationship was with a boy online. it started when i was 14. went on and off since i was 17. he said he would come to canada and marry me. we would have an amazing life together and have kids of our own. i was so happy. everyone around me told me he was mentally abusing me. i did not see it. but he would not let me have friends, he would get insanely jealous. i was not even allowed to go over to my female friends house, and when i did, he would get super angry. he controlled everything in my life. got upset when i went to school and did not stay home to talk to him. eventually he left me for one of my other friends online. i begged him to stay, i had never felt so broken. he did not. he would say awful things about me. the anxiety and depression got so bad i could not go to school. by this time, i was in grade 12. every time i walked in the school, i had a panic attack. could not be around people. i tried online school, i could not do it. it was too difficult without a teacher. i still have not graduated. i have never had a job its hard to leave my house. i cannot drive. i cannot cook. i cannot do anything by myself, my mother raised me to be super dependant. 3 years ago she started dating a guy now fiance she previously was best friends with. he was around me a lot when i was a child. i do not remember much. the meds make me forget most of my life including my school years. first couple years were fine. i eventually got really sick. last year i developed severe ocd. contamination ocd. i cannot touch anything he has touched. cannot have him in my apartment. my mother gets angry and blames me that she cannot be happy. i have tried 3 different meds since then, all the free therapists the government gives me. nothing helps. they say i developed ocd as i most likely have psychological issues with men because of all the wrong they have caused me in my life. my family all acknowledges i need professional psychological help. they do not have the money for it. my mom is on permanent medical assistance as she has severe stage 4 endometriosis. my dad lives with his girlfriend who has kids, they cannot afford me or take me in either. my grandparents just want to live a chill retired life. they do not want me. my brother lives in a different province. this takes me to why i need to get out of here, though i have no place to go. last night my mom got upset with me and said she wants her life back. she is sick of my mental illnesses and says she is going to have her fianc over. she acts like she forgets that i nearly starved to death last year, literally days away from starving, because i was too scared that what she cooked was contaminated because she was around him. the ambulance was called at my therapists office because he saw that i could barely stand up. i was shaking really bad. i was extremely malnourished. i was not able to shower for the same fear that she contaminated the shower. again last year my mother called the police on me because i said i did not want to live anymore after she had threatened our relationship if he does not come over. she said that she would not watch movies with me anymore or be around or spend time with me at all which really affected me because she was like my only friend. do not have barely any irl bc of my anxiety to leave the house and she knows this. everyone i do talk to says that she emotionally abuses me so bad. i have a video of her saying that our relationship is nothing now anyways. this week she said she was going to lock me out of the fridge for getting a piece of balongne. she said that i have gluten on my hands she has celiac even though i did not even touch anything with gluten, and she said that i am probably the reason why she is been sick this past year. she wants to move in with her fianc, and i am the one holding her back. she always makes sure to let me know that i am the reason why she cannot have happiness in her life. she makes me feel like i am just a roadblock. and so much more. so when the police were called they came into our small apartment 4 men. they forced the blood pressure machine on me even though i was crying telling them its contaminated. they told me to grow up and act like an adult. they told me that since they have been called twice now, that next time they are called they can put me in handcuffs and arrest me. it traumatized me so much. the self harm last year was out of control. since that year i have gotten so much better by myself since my mother had been cooperating with me, giving me time to get better before she has her fianc over. i do not wear gloves inside my house anymore. i can eat. i can shower. i do not self harm. i have been socializing online a lot. however last night when she said she was going to start having him over i have fallen into some of the same habits. have not really been eating. been super depressed. been crying and shaking all day. i am scared it will be as bad as last year probably way worse if he comes over. hell contaminate everything just by being in here. i am so scared. i will not be able to leave my closed room. ill be too afraid to eat or drink anything in fear of it being contaminated. i am so so scared. cannot stop shaking. threw up after i tried to eat something. last year i nearly died, i do not know what worse entitles. i am scared. i made so much progress. i do not want it all to be shattered. it will all be for nothing if she has him over. she will not let me get psychological help first either before she has him over. she says she cannot afford it and she is waited long enough. shaking while typing this. feel really sick. stopped talking to my friends. stopped doing anything except sitting in my room crying. she keeps threatening me that she will call the police again if i do not start eating. she says they will arrest me this time. but i feel so sick. i am so scared. no one can afford help for me. i cannot do anything. i am stuck. what do i do? i have psychological issues with men yet my mom is going to bring a man in the house. i am so scared. she does not care. i have tried reaching out to him personally and our family. no one cares. they all think i am being irrational. and that my mom deserves happiness too. they do not understand. no one does. and i am trapped. all i am is a roadblock. no one wants me. no one can take me. i am trapped in this home. it used to be the only place i feel safe, now its the scariest place. all i do is sleep because its the only time i am at peace. i cry every time i wake up because i realize i have to face this hell. i am trapped. i am scared. i have nowhere to go. what can i even do? i cannot drive to get out of

9298,"this is my first reddit post ever. i am wondering is this suicidal ideation the normal one i have always had, just with some of the emotion and anxiety lifted because of the meds? or is it additional from the meds? before the meds i have thought a lot about it and known already that it would be more preferable to not live in this horrid world than it would be. i am 36 so have had time to think and learn about the state of things. i am not the type to do the typical life with kids house all that stuff. i am really philosophical and get caught up in existential crisis all the time, the fact alone that people eat animals sends me into a dark spiral of not wanting to exist anymore. and then i think about things like people force feeding street drugs to babies.and obviously everything else that happens. and that people do not give a shit. about. anything. the earth, animals,other humans,anything. its sickening amd i just cannot handle it anymore.anyway, i do not think there is anything wrong with not wanting to live in a world like this, after all we were never given a choice. in fact i think it is normal not to want to, but that is just hushed in our society.so before starting the ssri generic lexapro i already knew and felt this, but was so overwhelmed with these thoughts and extreme extreme emotion and panic from it, along w the disarray of late diagnosed and unmanaged adult adhd life, i felt like i was exploding more every day. i could not even think about existence because it is just too unfathomable and awful that this is how things are. i was at my wits end and its what eventually made me decide to take the ssri in addition to already taking a very low dose stim for adhd , which i was resisting for a long time. always been antimeds but literally could not stand carrying on this way, so was desperate to try anything. i did not even care about my natural healing beliefs anymore. now, almost 1.5 month into the ssri, it is like the emotion amd anxiety about this has lifted, but the knowledge is still there. i am very clear and calm about it now. i am working on paying down my debt, which was another source of my woes, and finally in a financial position to be able to do it. and regularly think about once i get all of my debt paid down and all of my shit squared off, i can then consider planning an exit, if my attempts at happiness or even just contentment do not work. i am close with my sisters and family but they just started having kids, have their lives, and do all of that now, i am so far removed from wanting or relating to any of that, and while i love them deeply and they and my cats are the main reason i would not voluntarily leave this earth. each of us can only suffer for so long right? am i supposed to exist in hatred and stress forever because i do not want them to be sad about me leaving? i know it would be terrible for them amd selfish of me but in the end, they have their lives and their families and their kids and they would be able to move on with each other. the more they start developing their own families, the more detached i become and drawn towards this plan. and i am not irrational, it is not like i would just leave all my hoarded crap for them to deal with. i would tie up all my loose ends first and make sure my cats had someone to care for them. plus honestly, its almost like its motivation for me to get my shit together, to fix my financial life. and it is almost like i am planning a vacation or a trip, i feel the same way, that same eagerness or like i have this thing in the distance that i can look forward to. i have always needed things like that, probably the adhd, to know there is something coming up. its just that this something happens to be the end of everything. which is relief!so. is this alarming? i do not feel like it is, i cannot emphasize how surprisingly calm i feel about it. and like i have a secret too. but because i have never felt calm about it before, just want to reach out and see opinions. does anyone else feel this way and do you agree that its kindof more alarming to want to exist in this kind of world? at least if you are paying attention. and do not have kids to exist for.and i know i can talk to my or a therapist but i also do not want them freaking out and making a big deal out of it, that is why i would never tell family or the few friends i have. i think we are entitled to have these ideas. mostly just wondering if the ssri is strengthening them or just lifting the emotion out of it. sorry so long. any thoughts appreciated suicidal ideation, recent ssri, should i be alarmed?",Depression

7133,"hello! i am new here, but i have always lurked whenever the ideation sets in the back of my mind and does not let up.i have never gone to a therapist, mostly because i am studying in the same medical field so to speak, and i am scared i would bump into someone i know and spill out why i am there. although we are taught to never judge patients because it is just common courtesy. it feels like it is innate for us to judge, y'know? therapists are people too. we look at people everyday and form this prejudice we have in our heads. i, too, have judged a lot of people before. even those who open up to me like i am doing here now. i am scared that i will be judged by my peers. of older people who would not even dare to listen and understand. because i know, even if they do not tell me. they will think of me as this weakass, ungrateful lowlife.it is not normal to talk about mental health from where i am, after all.i have never once tried to selfdiagnose myself, as i think i cannot look objectively at my own situation. i am aware that what i am doing is selfdestructive, that loathing and ruminating all day long preoccupies me when i am supposed to be doing work. work that i do not want to do anymore. work that i want to quit forever.i feel miserable. i have for years now. being in a competitive environment medical school that i did not feel strongly about, that i did not feel like i wanted in the first place was soulcrushing at worst, and numbing at best. i have thought of killing myself thousands of times of jumping from a fivestory building, overdosing on ferrous sulfate pills, hanging myself, suffocating myself. sadly, like many things in my life, i never did succeed in doing any one of them. i never even attempted them. it seems that i am scared of the pain it will cost me, of how it will feel. of the possibility that i will survive to live another day with my family knowing that i tried doing it to myself. of the judgement they will give me.in conclusion, i care too much about what others think. of what they will feel. at the expense of myself. and i guess i will be stuck in this limbo indefinitely until i get better. if that time ever comes. thank you for reading. hey, you! hoping that you are just okay. i am in limbo.",Suicidal

19127,"i think i am depressed. i decided to type out and share some of my feelings and thoughts in order to get them off my chest and to hopefully receive some helpful advice or encouraging words from one of the people reading this.i was raised as a christian and i was a believer until my early teenage years. then, a relative of mine passed away, very suddenly, from cancer. she was still in her thirties. it made no sense to me. she was a very generous, sweet, hospitable, warm and loving woman. it made me question if there is a god and why he would allow something like this to happen to such a good person. the death of my relative turned me into a bit of a hedonist. my reasoning why would i do tedious things, if something like this can happen to anyone? what is the point in studying for a boring test when i could die tomorrow? i knew that the chances of me dying were slim, but there are never guarantees.then, i identified as an agnostic atheist for a few years, before i finally became an atheist a few years ago. i am now at a point where i believe our existence is merely a coincidence. we are just descendants of monkeys on a tiny blue rock and the unfortunate tragedy is that we can reflect on our own existence. i am the kind of person who tries to make sense of everything. i usually try to be as unbiased as possible and to use facts in order to form my opinion. that is why it is so hard for me to come to terms with the fact that life is very unfair and random.by making smart choices living healthily, working hard, etc, you can only increase your chances of living a good life, but there are no guarantees. our 1 and only life is a game of chance, which is a truth that is hard for me to fathom.the state of the world pisses me off too. why the fuck is there still racism? why are lgbtqia people still being treated unfairly? why are we allowing capitalism, overconsumption and greed to completely destroy our planet? why are there billionaires? why are millions of people starving, while others care about buying the latest clothes and gadgets? how am i supposed to care about school when these problems still exist? perhaps i am just a sensitive little bitch, idk.speaking of being a bitch, i fucking love my parents and i cannot stomach that someday, they will die. i start crying even just thinking about losing them at some point in the future. i genuinely believe they are some of the best human beings on the earth. i have thought about suicide but i do not think i would be able to do that to my parents, who are my everything. so the harsh reality is that either i will lose them, or they will lose me. so, if i do not want to commit suicide, it is inevitable that i will lose my parents at some point if i manage to live that long and that i will have to continue to live life on a planet full of greed and hate. a life that is inextricably linked to suffering. i have heard people say time and time again that life is suffering, but even when that is seen as a universal truth, that does not mean that it becomes easier to accept that truth. that truth does not suddenly become easier to bear.i have briefly read about camus and the myth of sisyphus and while i agree with his worldviews and the absurdity of life, i cannot really see myself following the example of sisyphus. i cannot see how i could accept having to roll the boulder up the hill for the rest of my life.for a few years, the idea of building a legacy intrigued me. what if i could make art or start institutions that could stand the test of time. my name would be cemented in history. then, i had a shocking realisation. when i die, i will not be there to enjoy the legacy i built. i do not know what to do. i still enjoy sports, hedonism and other forms of escapism, but only because they allow me a temporary escape from life's inherent suffering. perhaps i am a 'pussy' or a 'coward' but i honestly cannot take it anymore. this existence is overwhelming. fed up with this unfair and cruel world and life's inherent suffering",Depression

14301,so just to let you know where my head is at these days ill tell you about myself. i am 23m. my childhood was physically and emotionally abusive and i was neglected for a long time. the older i get i can see how this stuff has messed with me and how its always been messing with me and the way i socialize with people. i met my dad when i was 18 and he knew how my mom was but he did not want anything to do with me and my sister but he raised our half sister and gave her a great life. i never wanted to have kids and i was with this girl for 3 years and she begged me not to wear a condom said and that she was on birth control and i believed her and now she is pregnant and i am almost certain that its my daughter. she was born in april i think. i do not know her name or where she is. my ex just went crazy when she found out she was pregnant and she got back with her ex and she will not communicate with me at all. so that is what is been going on in my life. then i met this girl and started talking to her and she seemed to really like me and i really liked her a lot too. but all my anxiety and stuff was messing with me. when someone says something good to me i cannot believe its true for some reason and i feel like things are going to get real bad. this girl is becoming a counselor and she just seemed like the girl that came right out of my dreams. we were going out and having a real good time and then i did not hear from her one day and i got real nervous and had an anxiety attack. i feel so stupid for getting like that and getting attached but i was real nervous and did not want to wait around for her to open my snap so i text her and told her how i felt and that i hope she was not ignoring me and that she can just tell me anything. she text back and was sorry but i said a lot of stupid stuff for it being that early to talk to someone. this went on for another three weeks just being like warm and not like it was before when she was sending hearts and saying good morning sweetheart and saying she loved this and that about me. so these past three weeks just killed me because she said she still wanted to get together and that everything was okay. anyways i feel like that was too overwhelming for me and i told her how i felt and she started talking and said she was afraid it would not work out because we live like two hours away and she really wanted to be with means that she knew i was attached and she was too but she was afraid it would not work out and that she could not be what i wanted right now. i feel so stupid and i feel like i ruined things. i think i have jus got so much going on these days its already hard for me to function as it is and i was so happy to be talking to this girl it just sucks and i hate myself. i embarrassed myself so bad and ruined something that could have been great.,Depression

up.i ended up with no friends.in highschool my mother was the headmistress of the school so i never really knew if my classmates really wanted me as a friend or they wanted just because of the position of my mother.so i was 57 days of the weekend in that village my school was and the rest of the days i was with my fathermy parents are divorced i genuinely preferred him than my mother.i also had some bullies in the school .i never talked about them on the first year.so i got used to it and i did nothing.at least i had 2 new genuine friends.i really enjoyed spending time with them but to tell you the truth i never really liked that village as a place.anyway at the end of the year i met an old friend and we started hanging out.that summer my friend from the school came to the city i live and we decided to hung all together.the same day when we were out i reconnected with 4 old friends.and we all connectedexcept the guy from my schoolso 2 became 5 etc.at this point i was really happy and positive.2nd year of highschool began i had 2 friends in school and 5 friends in town.p.s my mother after the divorce had an affair but the 2nd year this guy went to live in france he was actually a good guy to me and to my mother he was more of a friend to me than a stepfather and i did not really bother but when he left,my mother started an affair with his brother ffs. he was kind of okay but sometimes when my mum got angry with meas always,there are many stuff that my mother did to me and my brother not all bad but that is for another storyhe would play the father role to me and i hated it. i wanted to leave my mum to live her life without me, i do not know if i was a good son or a bad son. i tried to leave her alonei eventually did this year and its painful for a mother and i was thinking how she would take it.thankfully covid19 appearedsorry for saying thisand i did not have to live in that place.i even held on better on my subjects.as you see i have not mentioned at all my love life in the story that is because i did not really have one as i avoided to make a relationship in that place cuz i hated it and i wanted to be far far away from it, its not that i could not make a relationship, as i rejected two girls not only because of the place but also due to my high standardsmostly the place though on summer of the 2nd year one of my friends introduced me to a female friend of his.at first i did not really noticed her but when we met for a second time due to my lack of social skills she would make the talk andshe talked to me she was staring at me smiling and then i thought that she was just perfect. the next days i would always find ways just to meet. i felt like she was flirting with me as we were in a library and she placed sth with flowers on my head and she smiled then she placed it on her and i told her that she looks nice with it and she smiled again. she would randomly touch me i never found the courage to touch her in return.anyway that was a nice moment for me but it ended up on rejection it was my 1st rejection as i never made the 1st move i have made only 3 relationships 1 rejection and i have rejected 5 girlssometimes i would reject some girls because i was afraidin 3rd year nothing happend due to covid19 i did not have to go to that place and i even had more time to hang out with friends. at the end of that seasonnow i had exams as well. i was not the best student even though my mother made it seem like i was . i never accepted it i did not want this to happen i did not want to give more reasons for my classmates to hate me. i did not even attend to my graduation ceremony because of this.so we come here to this day where i have my marks from my exams these exams in my country are the key to a successful life i have some options with the marks i got and i can get into a nice university.problem is that in my love life i do not know what to do i.i do not know if i am ugly or sth but this year i find it really

16185,"my 20th birthday is on the 31st of july. i will not make it. i am very certain i am going to kill myself in the next few days. probably today. weirdly, i am at peace with it. i have wanted to kill myself since i was about 12. anxiety and depression are just words to us now. we hear them everyday. we joke about it. hell, i constantly joke about it. that is precisely why we are so uncertain of ourselves when we really do feel weak, when we really do suffer from mental illnesses. because us, this modern world, has learned to destroy all things relative to an emotion. we really are depressed. we really do need help. but joking about it will always be a lot more fun than actually expressing how we feel. it gets to that point where you cannot even face your own siblings. when you cannot look at your own mother. when the feeling of shame that you do not really know how it built, overtakes you and you feel worthless. unwanted. every small insult will start to hurt you. every joke will burn and tear at your skin. its soon going to be all you hear when you stare at yourself through a mirror. your own words may bring you down. joking will not be funny anymore. but its too late the next generation has already starting joking about it too.being the funny person you are known to be will not be enough anymore. people will count on you for the jokes but you will not have them you have lost all your humor. its been torn away. you feel hungry but staring at your food is somehow the only thing you can do. and when you eventually eat it, all you can think about it how you should not have eaten it. how you are gaining weight. how all those compliments on your weight loss from your family will disappear and the ugly stares will come back. that is all you are known for, is not it? the things you never wanted to do. the starving yourself, the physical and mental stress you put yourself through for those marks, the crying at 5am because you cannot find the willpower to just stop thinking and sleep. the compliments wavering in and out of your head, the insults joining in. you do not know how it feels to have your own mother relentlessly insult and bring your self confidence down from a young age. you do not know how it feels to have absolutely, literally, nobody to talk to. you do not know how it feels to have your own parents beg you to be more like the other familys daughter. you do not know how it feels to not remember the last time you hugged, kissed, or even touched your own parent. you do not know how it feels to be told by your blood, your birthgiver, the woman who you wish you could respect and love, that you are unwanted. a mistake. the should have been a boy.i have never told my parents i loved them and they have never told me that either. my father is a depressed alcoholic whose parents are now both dead, and my mother is a raging, manipulative, bipolar narcissist who can never admit when she is at fault. she has always hated me. never really knew or understood why. guess i just was not a necessary child. i do not really have anything to offer. i am the ugliest kid, the weirdest, loudest, loser. it hurts when even your parents think you are a fucking joke. i have siblings but i doubt they will miss me too much. i am sure a tear might come to their eye when they think of our few good memories once i am gone, but like my sister once told me after i returned home from a three day trip away the family is just so much happier without me. my life is wonderful. i have been blessed with utmost things that i do not need yet my parents still bought me them like an ipod when i was a kid. i am thankful. i am. i have no reason to complain. everytime my mouth opens and i start to complain, or even think of complaining, i feel like killing myself. i do not deserve this life. the life that i have deserves to be given to a young boy or girl, unprivileged in a broken, impoverished society. they could have made much better use of this life than i have. i do not deserve anything good.well, this is it. this is not really a suicide note, i guess, but i do not really think i have the energy to write one. its not worth it, only because i truly doubt anyone would care to remember it. thanks for everything guys. to those people who come on here and write motivational, uplifting, genuine replies, who try their best to get people to stay longer on this planet you are heroes. truly, you really have saved me so many times with your words. i genuinely thank you. i hope you all find happiness and have great lives. oh and in case i do not see you good morning, good evening, and good night. july 18 2021",Suicidal

26449,"my mother is about to turn 70. she is a widow. through an unfortunate set of circumstances including years of guilt tripping on her part, i have found myself living at home with her again. she is also something of a narcissistic abuser. i understand that this is partly due to her own trauma with her own parents.she broke her arm recently and it gave me a taste of what being her caregiver would be like and i am terrified. she has a plethora of health issues some of which i believe to be exaggerated or that could be mitigated if she would just follow some reasonable health advice, but i know her well enough to know that if she can rely on me to do something, she would do that rather than try to be independent.everything i have read online about being a caregiver talks about how hard it is, but these people also say they would not have traded the experience for the world because of the time they got to spend with their parents. i cannot help but think that these people must have had better relationships with their parents to begin with.i cannot see a way out of it if i leave, i will never be free of the guilt trips from her and others in her life, unless i cut them off entirely. i hate the thought of her playing the victim and making me out to be a terrible villain for doing what is best for me.if i stay, i do not think i will survive because the thought of it makes me feel like i am suffocating. it makes me feel like my life is over already.i come from the sort of world where suicidal ideation is not taken seriously it is seen as asking for attention or being manipulative. saying something like the thought of being my mother's caretaker makes me think about suicide would not be met with sympathy, but rather with judgement about what a horrible person i ami am not in any danger right now, but i think about suicide and selfharm every day. i may become my mother's caregiver, and i keep thinking that i would rather die",Suicidal

47703,"i feel like i'm finally ready to end it all. these last 5 years have taken such a toll on me, that i just don't have the will to go on. my father was never in my life much, and my mother was more interested in alcohol and weed than myself and brothers wellbeing. the only paternal support we've really had is from our grandma. she has always done what she thought was best for my brother and me, though she wasn't always able to give us the emotional support we needed. i've struggled with anxiety and depression since i was a teenager, and never had any sense of self worth or respect. the friends i had were their for convenience, we shared some similar hobbies, and i was willing to do whatever they needed if that meant we could hang out. when i was 22, i started hanging out with a kind of bad crowd. we mainly got high and went to festivals and got drunk downtown. there were fun moments, but eventually an incident happened at a festival and i stopped hanging out with them. i did coke for the first time at this festival, and they all left me alone for the day. afterwards, i stopped hanging out with them, more so out of getting my head straight, but none of then reached out to ke. even to this day. i still see them from time to time around town, and they've all moved on to become better updmstanding people. still hanging out together. without me. after that happened i focused on work, did a bit of job hopping, started being healthier, lost a ton of weight i was obese from middle school up to 23, and eventually my brother and i moved out into another apartment together with our grandma. he soon met a woman and got married, and they moved into their own place, so it was just me and my grandma. i did eventually meet a girl, and after a year i also moved into a place with her when i was 26. it was good for awhile, but her mom hated me. i wasn't extremely religious. i'm not against it in any way, but i don't need a book to tell me how to be a good person. she judged me from our first meeting, especially since i didn't come from a good stable background. i'm glossing over a lot but it had a significant impact on our relationship. we live there together for 1 year. i don't know when it started, but we would get into these intense arguments. she had a lot going on with her family and job, and along with covid and isolation, the stress was too much for us to work through. after 7 months of living together we broke up. i left the apartment and went back to my grandmas place. we tried to stay friends, but i've realized that the changes in her personality have become too toxic for me. she knows my struggles with my insecurities, my depression, my anxiety, and even my family issues. up until yesterday, she used that to manipulate me into being there for her emotionally. i kept struggling to break away, but she would bring up my past mistakes in our relationship and guilt me to continue being there for her. anyways i went back to one of my old jobs, and was there until this past january. i left because i felt like i reached my peak. the customers were getting worse, we got a new manager who complete changed everything to their liking. i was overworked and felt undervalued. i didn't have a game plan, i just knew that for my mental health i needed to leave. since then i havent found any kind of job. since i left school, i dont hsve any qualifications except for retail, fast food, and other menial jobs. in the past year i gained back all the weight i lost. my body has been going through certain issues that i truly can't even afford to go to the doctor for. my grandma, bless her heart, hasn't been too pushy about me finding a job. but i can see her irritation in her eyes. i know she's concerned about me isolating myself in my room. i don't even play games much anymore. i just waste my days browsing online, looking for jobs, and then just laying in bed thinking of my life. i have no one close around me. i have no friends, no so, and i can't even talk to my brother about my depression. i know he's going through his own stuff, and he's tried to get me to play games with him but i feel like he should just focus on himself. the last two days i've been contemplating my life, my place in the world. i've come to the conclusion that i am just someone who doesn't belong. i'm not destined for a good life, not even an ok life. when i felt it was good it was ripped away from me, despite all my efforts to fix everything. i'm starting over from the bottom. living with my grandma again. overweight, jobless, and no real worth. i always felt so shityy for it, but i finally made my peace. i've struggled with suicide though a lot lately, i was afraid of actually going through with it because of my grandma and brother. even my mommombit. i know they will be heartbroken, i know it will take some time for them to recover, but they will eventually. my grandma is so emotion strong, and my brother, while he will be more hurt from it, is also stronger than me emotionally. he also has his wife there to support him. we used to talk about suicide when things were bad, and he always said no matter what happened to us he would never be ble to go through with that. i used to think i couldn't either.i guess i truly am a weakling. i know it'll be hard for them, but i feel that their lives will be so much easier once they don't have to worry about me anymore. i've made peace with it. they were the last things holding me back, but i don't feel worried anymore. they'll be able to live their lives when i'm gone, and i won't be a burden for them and for myself anymore. i'm exhausted. every day is such a struggle to get up and try. lately i've been having nightmares. they've gotten worse, and i feel this is the only way to stop. i'm tired of fighting, i'm tired of trying. i've accepted that i'm not meant for anything, and i've accepted i don't deserve happiness. i'm ready now. for the first time in 5 years i've bought some wine. i hate wine with a passion, but it aas on clearance and i just needed to get my head to stop thinking. once she leaves for work tomorrowi think ill just drink myself stulud. i dont know whatll happen, maybe i wont go through wjth it, but this is the first time ive felt good about ending it. all i can think of is how itll be overoveri wont have to suffer anymore, i wont be a

14674,"something told me to make this post. i do not want sympathy, or i am sorry, or any of that. i am past that. i have made lots of posts in the past to get that kind of response. that kind of connection to another human, recognize my pain. this post is not about that, it may seem like it is, i suppose, but it is not. i guess, i just want to tell the story of why i have depression and anxiety and so many other mental illnesses. it is going to be a long post, and for that, i do not expect many people to read it.i have contemplated suicide, but never attempted it. by contemplate, i mean i held a gun in my hand, looked it up and down, loaded it, put it in my mouth, put it against my head, and thought very deeply about pulling the trigger. i have contemplated suicide for at least 10 years now. it has put me in a state where i am both godless and godfearing. the best place to start, i think, is the first trauma i remember and go from there. when i was about 56 i had a crush on a boy in my class. if it matters, i am a bisexual male, more on that later. well, i was quite innocent of the idea of love and what one should like and not like, so i told my mom about the crush. her response was to scratch me across the face and call me a faggot. i still have the scars to this day. four scars on the left side of my face. i made a post the other day showing my face, but you cannot really see them, i do not like to draw attention to them, and thankfully no one has ever asked about them.that is the tip of the iceberg. when my parents were still together, she would lock us out of the house. hot summer days in the ohio river valley. we would be out there for hours, upwards of 6 hours without water or food. and really i guess this is the lesser of it, not so bad, we were kids, play outside she would tell us. so we did, we just could not go back in until she called us. anyways, i really looked forward to school days. this went on for a few years, i was between the ages of 5 and 10.school itself was not so bad. i did not learn to read until i was in the 3rd grade, and i was always taken out of class because i had special classes i had to go to, including one for a speech impediment, i could not say my rs, the speech impediment went on till i was almost in high school.well, when my parents got divorced was when the fun really began, i say fun because i try to think on the lighter side of it, could have been worse. i remember every aspect of the father's first apartment. we lived near a small airport, the house was two stories, we lived on the first floor. entering the house, on the right was a staircase that led upstairs to the landlord's apartment. directly in front of the front door was the door that led into the basement, where the washer and dryer were, concrete floors, largely empty space, was not much in there. the third door was my father's apartment, to the left. a white door, it led into the living room. there was a fireplace, a smallish tv, the couch my sister slept on, my dad's drawing table, and a couple of bookcases. in fact, i am going to stop here and suffice to say that i could describe to you every detail of that apartment. all except my room. i can not tell you anything about my room. i do not know what color the door was, i do not know what side of the wall the beds were on, i know nothing about that room. what i do know, or at least strongly suspect, is that i was raped in that room over a period of 2 years. aforementioned memory lapse aside, i am told by my brother that i say no, do not do it, stop in my sleep quite often. my sister, deceased sister, had similar gaps of memory and told me one day that she suspected it was happening. and thirdly, nsfw warning, my anus has a tear in it. i was about 1214, as memory serves that i lived in that apartment on the weekends. a mighty bold claim, i do not remember the actual events, but i believe there is evidence to lead to that conclusion. i want to think that i am wrong, but part of me tells me it is true.there are more minor things in my childhood that come to mind, but i think they really do pale compared to what i have already said. to this day, my family is, well, unloving. they will tell me they love me, but they do not show it. in fact, the only time they really listen, or halflisten, is when i threaten suicide. this could be why i contemplate it so much, just to be heard. neither of my parents could give a shit about what inspires me, what passions i have, what love i feel. two examples, i wanted to be a paleontologist until i was 16, loved dinosaurs, i kept this, like many other things, to myself, until one day i told my dad. he said i would never be a paleontologist, i should give up on that idea, and that i should instead be an engineer like he was. the second example, i love playing the piano, i know virtually nothing about it, i am selftaught, and frankly, i feel i can play a pretty damn good improv. my mother, frequently, tells me i am terrible at it and that i need lessons. which may very well be true, i may be terrible and everyone else who has heard me play is lying to me, i do certainly need lessons because i cannot read music, although i do not have much interest in playing what someone else wrote, it is an emotional release for me and i like it that way, so i am stubborn.perhaps some of this post is just whining, i need to grow up, i need to move on. i should not be defined by my past or what others say. and most of the time i try to keep that mindset, what is in the past is in the past, but i was once told by a very wise man to not use the word but, because it negates everything you said before, i feel it is needed here the past can still hurt. and perhaps that is why i am making this post, not on a throwaway account, i thought about that. but like my scars, let the world see this, my past does define me in some way, it has certainly shaped me. i have come to the end of this post and i still don' know the purpose. it does not make it feel any better, and no one can go back and change any of this, and quite frankly i am not even depressed about it right now. i was earlier today when my brother threatened to kick me out because i have not done the dishes in a few days, but not at the moment of writing. maybe, and i think this is true, maybe i just need someone to know these things. not because it has any real impact on their life, i certainly do not think anyone is going to read this and say, my god, my life is changed. no, i think i just wanted someone to know my pain, my past. i suppose i am sorry you read that. me",Depression

23269,"hello to whomever might be reading.the last nine months have been hell for me. i have been through legal issues caused by someone else, that made it impossible for me to work while that was being sorted out, and i am only now able to start working again but i have lost my whole savings trying to support myself for months. i have also been only able to afford a meal a day since around april, so i am all sorts of weak right now. in that time, i have also been heavily triggered by ptsd caused by abuse in my childhood as the abusive parent was the one that caused those legal issues that affected me. i would also been unable to do any activities since covid19 that were fundamental to my mental wellbeing. now that work is starting, i am working six day weeks and waiting for my first paycheck in august so i can start eating regularly again. being depressed, i found it hard to find enjoyment in anything, and still do. and yes, my mind has and continues to go to dark places, and i am actively trying to counter them with tools i have gotten in therapy over the years, and some days are more successful than others.so for the past year, the only constant thing i would enjoyed was a video game. in time, i even stopped enjoying the gameplay itself but fell in love with its characters, one in particular who reminded me a lot of myself. he was just so adorable and sweet, even if the graphics were a little behind the times. so when i had nothing else going on, i could just play the game and take comfort in his presence. it was one of the only few things i had for comfort.the company making the video game just recently announced that they were remodeling the characters and my character looks very different. he feels and looks like a completely new person. and while it might seem very trivial. it was pretty much the last straw that broke me down. i have contacted the company a few times, no response, and they do not address it on social media. and i avoid social media because people are quick to insult you for feeling so strongly about a video game character. i am just finding it hard to play this game anymore, which leaves me with. nothing. no other video game, no other activity, no other comfort character. it is like when your favorite character dies in a movie or book, except then you can still go back and enjoy them. with this, he is just. gone. it feels like i have lost a close friend.i feel empty. i would rather not be told how trivial all this might seem, because intellectually, i know. i just would very much like to be understood and empathized with right now so i can try to muster the strength to move on. my last straw was a change in the video game i play",Depression

34485,"persistent pain in fibrocystic breast anyone have similar experiences? a couple months ago i got a checkup because my breasts have always felt lumpy. doctor felt with her hands and said they felt like normal lumpy breasts. i got an ultrasound and was told i have fibrocystic breasts. cool! i could finally relax. a month later, i literally woke up one day and felt a pain in my right breast i hadn't felt before. i don't know if pain is what i should use since it doesn't hurt too bad, but i can definately and specifically feel it, and it's a sensation i don't feel anywhere else in my breast. ever since it randomly started that day, months later, it is persistent and i still feel it in the same spot. i'll feel it twinge throughout the day. it hasn't been getting more painful, but it is a specific sensation in the same spot although sometimes when i sleep it'll feel slightly painfulmore pronounced in the morning, but then goes back to its normal sensation after i move around. it also hurts when i feelknead it with my hands, but so do many other parts of my boobs. during my cycle, my nipples will get sore a few days before my period, and then feel normal again once it starts that is the way my breasts have acted during my cycle for years. this new specific sensation in my breast is persistant throughout the month, and i believe it's unrelated to my cycle. has anyone had similar experiences like this? any advice, similar experiences, or concerns if something's going on with me that i should get checked out would be appreciated. i'm so mad this pain decided to start right after i finally got an ultrasound, so i feel obtuse about going to get it checked out again, especially considering i don't know what else could be done to examine it besides getting another ultrasound.",Anxiety

16831,"sup guys so i have had a funky time with mental health. after having a very fun depressive few months. years on and off i really and i mean really want to get rid of this clingy stubborn crap stain of a companion.i have tried doing that by trying to enjoy life more. and you know i am really fucking happy to admit that i think i am almost there. but its like i am sitting on the edge of a cliff and when i look down i can see the type of person i want to be but becoming that person feels like i am going to have to jump off and here is why. i want to be able to wear clothes that look nice and make me feel nice when wearing them. i want to have a better relationship with my parents and sibling. i want to focus on my hobbies like art and writing. start cooking and doing it more often instead of just eating cup noodles. i want to start enjoying train rides to cities looking at the opera house at sunset, meeting new people, having lots of plants, doing things that make me feel at peace. man, i just really want to start enjoying life.but every time i do things that i have always wanted to do i remember why i did not do it before and what stopped me. every time i wear clothes i am excited to wear i keep thinking how bad they look on me. i remember looking through my clothes and putting together outfits i might be able to wear if lockdown gets any better but after every outfit deep down i did not like how my body looked on all of them. i have gained weight and it feels even worse when my mum comments on how fat i look. i am 57 kilos and 163 cm which might be chubby but personally would not go on to say i am fat yeah know? however to my mum, it is beyond every time i come to have a conversation with her, she comments on my weight, my hair, my looks. i remember she used to comment a lot on my grades but after i got a's and made it into a competitive school she stopped and went on other things, the constant shame of grades had driven me into trying so damn hard at school thinking maybe if i get better grades my mum will get off my back. but its as if the more i try to make her proud the more ways she finds to get disappointed. but she is my mum, she is toxic sometimes but i know that she cares and certain times she shows it. but it is hard. it is hard having conversations with my family. there so. strict and hard to talk to. so judgemental. so overdramatic. whenever i talk to them i get reminded why i did not. my mum always says i am just avoiding my family i say that i am busy but the truth is i just want to have a nice time with them but i am scared. i am scared that they will say something mean and either ill have to pretend it does not bother me just to maintain, peace or ill let it get to me and get emotional. whenever i do art, write poems do things that i like i regret doing it because i simply do not have time. i barely have time. school takes up most of my time, it is like i have no free time. every time i do have free time i study. study, study, study. even though i am well aware it will not mean anything to my parents. it is like second nature. i cannot stop thinking about school. i go tutoring in the city, so aesthetic train rides to the city? yeah reminds me of all the hours i spend on saturday doing math. it is just that. when i start getting better, all i can see are my flaws. i am emotional, a workaholic, stressed all the damn time, insecure. i get so disappointed, soon enough before i know it. all the motivation i have to get better disappears. and i am back to square one. i think one of the first steps to getting better is understanding i am very flawed but what after? and how do i get past this? i want to get better for myself, for my mum to stop worrying about me, so i stop getting annoyed at my little brother, being a bother to my friends. i really want to stop hating life because to be honest i have got so many good things i want to look forward too, so many good people i love. yet deep down i always get worse, i always get dissapointed, i always get fucking tired of life all over again i want this time to last. how do i look at my flaws and not hate myself and get depressed all over again? how can i look at my flaws and still be. ok?",Depression

25900,"he cries every day. the first thing he always talks about when he wakes up is how much he wants to die and wishes he did not wake up, everyday without fail. for months he is said everyday has made him want to die more than the last. hes begged me to kill him, so hand him poinson while bawling so hard on the floor he cannot get up to get it himself. he said you would be mercy killing me. he cannot go to a mental hospital for various reasons, we are both minors i am emancipated hes not living alone together, and he has quite a long time before he becomes an adult with controlling over his own life. his mom neglects him and refuses to give him the medical help he needs despite his therapist telling her how at risk he is for suicide, she will not allow him to transition we are both transgender and he feels like nothing could ever make him see the light through the dark. not even me. not even smoking weed helps him anymore because he does not even get stoned anymore and that is the only thing that slows his thoughts and eases his ptsd. on top of that were financially struggling and we cannot afford to keep buying weed but if i do not keep buying i risk coming home to find my boyfriend dead. i would reach out to authorities and ask him to be helped but we live in a rural bible belt community that would surely make things worse rather than better for him. he recently told me next time you go back to work, i am going to do it. i can give anymore. its too painful. all of our friend manipulate us and we cannot trust them. it took me days of spending every second bwside him to assure him i would not be ask okay as he thinks i would be if he was not here. he told me its going to be okay when i am gone. do not be sad, please move on and be happy. he feels so alone like he only has me. and it took the risk of getting fired and losing the house to make him promise me i would not come home to a corpse. i told him i could not go back to work until i knew. i know he still wants to die more and more every day, and he cries more and more every day about the pain of being alive and reliving his trauma and worrying about everything and feeling so out of place and uncomfortable amd burdening in any situation hes placed in. i do not care how worn out and exaughsted i am only sleeping one hour a night making sure he does not kill himself, i love him and i need him. but i know its selfish to keep him here under so much suffering. i feel its comparable to watching somome go through chemo without hope of even going into remission, knowing they are going to die in pain and just wanting for that day to come. but i need you in my life. but i need my life to be over to feel any sense of peace. he tells me it follows him into his sleep. he cannot escape the ptsd and the trauma and the thoughts and his therapist treats him like a kid so they do not do sessions anymore because all she talks about is school, which is another reason he wants to die. he does not see any positives to living and it is rare for me to come up with ideas that actually make him feel better. he never feels better for more than a few minutes at a time. hes been through depressive episodes before but none that have been this harsh and long, ever. i have never seen or heard of anyone who seems to be living in such a constant state of agony. he craves the pain of death because to him it is an answer to his prayers of escape. i do not know what to do anymore. i feel like it is only a matter of time before i loose him and he keeps telling me that too. there is no adults who can help him now, atleast not in the situation hes in. i just need to know what to say or do. i need to know that i am doing the right thing by keeping him alive, even though i can tell it tourchers him to be conflicted about hurting me and hurting more each day. am i doing the wrong thing? sometimes it feels like i am. please help. i do not know how to help my boyfriend. what should i do?",Suicidal

19710,"i am 25 years old. i have struggled with social anxiety, depression, disordered eating and gender dysphoria since i was 13. twelve years of suffering. this past yearandahalf the pandemic came along, of course, and destroyed any improvements i might have made prior to it even if some of those were admittedly a bit of a facade, me convincing myself and others i would improved because i am doing this good thing now and i am not doing that bad thing anymore. the pandemic has affected everyone in different ways i feel like it is effects for me have been multiple and some of then i am feeling far more now at the end of lockdown than i ever did during the height of lockdown.there is the enforced isolation, which has increased my social anxiety tenfold, to the point where the loosening of restrictions only means i am isolating even more because there is too many people outside and i cannot cope with them seeing me, looking at me, interacting with me, forming an opinion of me even a splitsecond, meaningless judgement is terrifying. i know it is irrational, but social anxiety has this way of making the irrational fears so loud and intrusive that they can become selffulfilling. i can rationally say to myself, nobody cares, nobody's looking at you. then i take a 5 minute walk to the shop and have a panic attack due to being so overwhelmed with anxiety. well now everyone is looking at you, because you are staggering around hyperventilating clutching your chest like you are having a heart attack, you dumb shit. then there is all the time spent alone with my own thoughts, ruminating over every little thing i have ever said and done, punishing myself and berating myself for things i said without thinking back in normal times when facetoface social interaction was a daily occurrence so i let my guard and filter down. i do not just mean cringey moments although i have plenty of those too, but cruel or thoughtless comments and actions which honestly just make me a terrible human being. then there is the doomscrolling. literally, on news websites etc. but also figuratively, in my own mind, which was arguably the master of spiralling into negative and pessimistic thoughts about the world long before doomscrolling was even a term. thinking about how we got here and where we are headed and how fucked up the world is. overpopulation and overconsumption and human selfishness and speciesism mean future pandemics and local and global travesties are only going to get more common. this is not the end, it is just the beginning. climate change is always on my mind, to some degree. i feel helpless and hopeless, i do not believe humanity will change enough or in time to save this planet. i do the things i can, but i am painfully aware i could be doing more and be more of an activist if i was less depressed and selfpitying. i am also painfully aware that i could do everything in my power and it would not scratch the surface, so long as huge moneyobsessed corporations continue to because more destruction in a day than i could in a year, even if i did not bother to try at all. my gender dysphoria is worse because i was forced to sit with my thoughts and acknowledge it for what it really is and always has been. denial is not healthy, but it sure feels better sometimes than admitting an uncomfortable truth to yourself. and once you admit that truth? you have to fight tooth and nail to get the things required to finally feel comfortable in your own damn skin. i am lucky that coming out was relatively safe and painless for me in terms of others' reactions, and i am so grateful for that. but boy is it a lot of work having to repeatedly prove your identity to strangers, while constantly secondguessing it yourself hello, imposter syndrome, only to be told everything is a 3 year wait and costs thousands. fill out this form and take this test and pay for this consultation and even then you are not our ideal candidate, so we will get back to you. it is exhausting and i have so little fight left in me. giving up means giving up any possibility that i will ever be happy but sometimes i still want to, just because i am tired of it. that last sentence was about my gender dysphoria, sure, but it is also how i feel about life as a whole. suicide is giving up. a dead person cannot be happy, but they cannot be miserable either. i am also in physical pain that i cannot get looked at by a medical professional because the doctors need photo id to update my name, which i do not have. my back and knees are a steady 310 when busy or distracted. 710 when i try to sleep, unless i am blackout drunk. 910 if i smoke weed, for some reason. everyone talks about weed helping with pain, but if i smoke i am damn near calling myself an ambulance just to get highstrength painkillers because my back hurts so much. i feel fairly sure the physical pain is related to a sedentary lifestyle. i sit at work all day, then i sit and watch tv or go to bed early, i do not exercise because i am scared to go outside and besides i have no motivation. it cannot be good for me and i think my body is trying to tell me that. every time i try to end a post like this i think of something else, another reason i feel so suicidal. maybe i should focus on the positives? i am young, maybe not in tiptop physical condition but probably fixable to a decent standard of healthcomfort with the right treatment and effort. i live in a wealthy country with access to everything i could ever need. i have a job, i am financially independent, i can make rent and pay for food and even luxuries. i have a family who love me especially my mum, who means everything to me. i could probably be fairly attractive if i worked out and took better care of myself. i am not unintelligent and i have some compassion, so i could probably do things to help people and better the world if i put more effort in. all of these positives just fill me with so much guilt. i do not deserve these benefits or opportunities, they are wasted on me. focusing on the positives makes me wish someone else could take my place and be in my position and make full use of it, so i could just be dead. i just want to kill myself. i just want to kill myself",Depression

20194,"i have always had a very hard time making friends. because of trauma i have been very fearful of people for as long as i can remember. i have always been labeled as a very smart, pretty, but very quiet and innocent girl. wellbehaved, pious, never gets into trouble. i still have not gotten used to being called super weird and stuckup for it. the vast majority of my social interactionssocial life throughout my life have only come from the internet, ever since i got unsupervised access on my ipod touch at 9 years old. you know what that leads to, especially for a young girl. after so many dangerous and depraved people took advantage of me online, on top of the trauma i have experienced off line, something in me switched. i shaved my head, stopped wearing make up, gained 20 pounds, and wore masculine clothes. i have only realized why i did all that in retrospect.most of my very few closest 'friends' in my offline life were my bullies. it was not until i was around 16 years old and put in life threatening and extremely humiliating situations by someone who claimed to love me, plus having the pandemic where i was withdrawing from the drugs they gave me, did i snap out of that mindset that i have been conditioned to accept. people who love you can hurt you sometimes but my tolerance for being hurt was so extreme to the point of thinking that abuse was counted among that. i have just become an adult now. it is now my responsibility to help myself heal. i no longer can dream about the day when someone will swoop in and rescue me. i have been in therapy since i was 12 years old, been in and out of mental hospitals and tried multiple medications. i have spent most of my days laying on my bed, scrolling the internet, consuming an ungodly amount of information and seen things i never wish i did. most of my crushes have been someone who has lived several miles away. i would get clingy, my anxiety and ocd would go through the roof, pushing them away. all my romantic relationships have been online. one that was very abusive and leaked me, to which my therapist at the time said that it was something i would get over very soon and that i should not worry about it, and chuckled. i have ended my first healthy relationship some days ago bc they could not handle distance anymore. it makes me feel like a fucking loser. she will have so much friends and family to be able to heal and i do not have that shit. the fact that on the surface it does not even seem to make sense to other people as to how i could be suffering so much makes me feel even more alone. i have literally had a teacher tell me that they do not understand how i could be depressed if i am pretty and smart after i cried in class and was not turning things in on my best subject. i have had multiple educators and adults say a similar thing even after i explain i am mentally ill.you are so articulate with so much potential. i know you are depressed but we all struggle to get out of bed sometimes. you just have to push yourself. i will explain i am very suicidal and i will get but you are going to therapy and are on meds. you are so bright so if you just try a little harder you could get straight as. been told this by so many special education teachers and school counselors that preach so much on mental health.maybe they have a point. i bet some of you would agree. i am not ugly, i am not dumb, i do not come from poverty, my parents' are not drug addicts and are well educated. maybe i should just stfu. at times i wish did not have those things so then maybe my suffering could be taken more seriously.okay, my pity party is over. i have so much life ahead of me, like whatever. if i do not delete myself tonight i will feel so so disappointed. but you have so much potential!",Suicidal

20769,"i realised last night that i have been inherently and subconsciously faking being mentally ill for seven years now. i am 17, this started when i was 10. when i was 10 years old i began to completely romanticise depression and self harm thanks to the internet and emo music, i thought it was cool. i was really lonely because my friends were leaving me out, and i got sexually assaulted that same year nothing bad, i was not hurt or raped but it has affected me a little bit i guess so i guess i pretended to be depressed as a cry for help. then when i was 11 i was bullied for a year by those same friends, and it really hurt because i was so attached to one of them. during that year i self diagnosed myself with schizophrenia because i thought it was cool. i was experiencing genuine depression and suicidal thoughts but i was really. public and attention seeking about it online, like i would post about being depressed on forums and stuff. then in 2016 i was still running with the depressed thing, and this time i thought i had bpd because i was obsessed with and stalking an online friend who groomed me this obsession lasted two years. i was starting to get into my actual emo phase then, when i was 12, which i am still in today tbh lol.but 2017 was my worst year for being suicidal, like genuinely. i self harmed a lot and still romanticised my depression. all of my irl friends did it, too, it was a horrible group of glorifying self harm and being sad and stuff. i would cut myself and sneakily put my bloody arm up right in front of a friend so they would get concerned. it was stupid but admittedly a really painful year mentally, i totally hated myself because of what my friends who bullied me had said lol.2018 was my rebellious phase. i started getting into grunge music, idolising underweight men and becoming disordered with my eating habits, becoming obsessed with drugs and being cool and being impulsive, so i got a stick and poke tattoo and would sneak out regularly with friends and stuff. then in early 2019 we got caught drinking cough syrup lol, so i learnt my lesson and never again. 2019 was my first year of real isolation. i moved away to a different school and was on my own a lot, and when i was not i was smoking weed and cigarettes and partying with old irl friends. i really fucked up though, because the weed led me to dissociating extremely heavily for a long time, and i heavily believed in solipsism which is the philosophical belief that you are the only being to exist. i also became obsessed with school shooters, specifically dylan klebold, and heavily idolised him up until this year tbh. i dealt with feelings of being nonhuman and not real but i also had really bad social anxiety so the dissociation was just to cope lol. went to therapy and got over the anxiety rather quickly.2020, it was still school shooters but then i fell in love with my best friend and became convinced i had bpd again. we actually dated on and off a few times that year but it was horrible, we were horrible for each other and i was genuinely abusive to a lot of people and i went through a lot of pain. in october she broke up with me and i full on developed anorexia, which i am still struggling with now but am in therapy for. 2021, now up until recently i believed i had adhd because i have shown a lot of symptoms since i was a child, and bipolar disorder, and npd but i have genuinely shown narcissistic traits since i was 14. i also let myself get groomed again but i am out of the relationship now. i have gone to attempt suicide twice this year except i pussy out and get help and this has been the first time my parents have learnt about my struggles with mental illness i do not mean to dismiss anyone's struggles, just my own haha. they are fine about it and supportive and getting me help but last night i realised none of it matters because i have been faking it the entire fucking time. there is never been anything wrong with me, i have just been very good at convincing myself. it all comes from a need for love and attention and approval i have had for as long as i remember, which is like, five. i pretended to be narcissistic and love myself because i have crippingly low self esteem and a need for control. but now i do not know what to do, i do not know how to unlearn these behaviours i have ingrained in my psyche. i feel really upset when i think about not being like this but i do not know what i am trying to achieve. my sense of self is literally completely gone now, it is so embarrassing.tldr i need help because i realised all of my mental illness is because i began romanticising depression when i was ten years old i am 17 now. over the years i have developed a smorgasbord of symptoms from mental illnesses i have completely convinced myself that i have, but now i know none of it is real, i do not know how to unlearn them and quite frankly i am terrified to be truly myself and be happy. these symptoms have ingrained themselves into my being and without being mentally ill i literally do not know who i am. it is making me anxious and distressed and extremely suicidal. i do not know what to

8434,"hopefully my behaviour can help find out why. i tend to be very apathetic, apart from when i am stuck into researching my favourite subject which is nutrition and have become very impatient with my former favourite hobby i engaged in to relieve boredom, which are video games. i have some suicidal ideation, because nutrition can only provide so much information and find it extremely difficult to start new hobbies like learning an instrument. i have so far failed to mention my autism, which i inherited from my purely parental lineage and had diagnosed from a professional and autism has been linked with depression, although i do doubt my diagnosis to a small degree. my heart rate is in the 90s which is a possible indicator that something is wrong with me since higher heart rates are linked with depression, shorter life spans and a greater chance of cvd, although i am exercising and eating some legumes to lower it as much as possible. i am taking lamogtrigine which is supposed to stabilize my mood, as my consultant thinks that i may have bipolar and i am growing some broccoli sprouts to treat my autism as it is the only shown treatment of autism there is, if i even have it in the first place.i am whole food starch based, but i understand if you do not want to leave animal products behind, as my oldest sister still likes them.my main issue with making friends is anticipatory anxiety, possibly induced by church up until we stopped attending, much to the dismay of the pastors at 14 and maybe attending school at 14 after a history of only homeschooling. i am completely fine in the presence of others, like at school and can tolerate them fairly well outside of regular social meetings, but the main reward is walking out of the regular meetings for sure, knowing i have some time before i encounter them again. quickly going back to nutrition, i think i might be deficient in both calcium and magnesium, which seem to have a role in mood, alongside the obvious ones being bones and muscles and i am also taking ashwaganda. my grandfather on my fathers side, the autistic and very quiet one who only every talked to my mother once in his entire life, thankfully it being the pleasant topic of his civil engineering career. he shook hands with the queen for an important construction project once, despite being very middle class. i also have problems falling asleep at regular times, but no issue getting it consistently. i must further mention that i have had severe seperation anxiety based on my mother, to the point where i very rarely could be left with strangers and could not even be held by my own father, who has suffered from general anxiety for as long as he can remember.i grew up in a christian community and also a completely secular sailing club, which gave me the feeling of being jekyll and hyde before having known about the book. but both feelings where equally enjoyable. although i was in a christian environment much more. this was balanced out by three and a half years of schooling i suppose, although one of my friends at church who i do not see anymore thought religion was stupid and my mother and i think he could have been autistic. i keep in sparse contact with one friend from my christianhood and none of the good friends i made in public school.and yet, after all of my research into nutrition and other lifestyle changes, such as aerobic fitness, what could be the because of my low mood? any supplements you guys would recommend, as i am also taking boron which is a unessential mineral that boosts testosterone a fair amount among other things.thanks for reading this long post. what could be causing my suicidal ideation?",Suicidal

52076,looking for perspective i f18 have been given the diagnosis of gad generalized anxiety disorder and it has taken an extraordinary toll on my physical health. i am in a constant state of fight or flight and ive never been in this much pain in my life. its the kind of pain people kill themselves from. i am constantly shaking and throwing up. this constant stress has given me the diagnosis of ibs irritable bowel syndrome. i had to go to multiple doctors as ibs is hard to diagnose. the stomach pain triggers the anxiety and the anxiety triggers the stomach pain so basically im constantly in both mental and physical pain. however i believe it goes deeper than gad. it doesnt stop. its not attacks either it doesnt come or go. it stays. ive taken benzos and they dont do shit for me and neither does any depression or anxiety medications. i wish i could be sedated so i dont have to be awake and in pain. there have been a few incidents where i had to go to the hospital and beg to be sedated or at least booty juiced or something that would put me to sleep. luckily i found lamictal and it has saved my life. i honestly dont think i would be alive today if it hadnt been for modern medicine. but this still raises the question of what is actually wrong with me. im thinking of this because my lamictal is beginning to lose its effect and i have to increase my dose every couple of weeks. i couldnt get a therapy appointment scheduled until late june so im kinda fucked.,Anxiety

23184,"it is my birthday next monday.last september i was in the psych ward under suicide watch after 6 months of activepassive suicidal ideation. i have bipolar 2, cptsd, childhood sexual abuse, in recovery from an eating disorder, treatment resistant depression, psychogenic nonepileptic seizures since all my tests have come out non conclusive, a history of alcoholism and addiction in my family, as well as a current substance use disorder, and situational trauma from immigration, cheating and divorce.i have worked as a caregiver in treatment facilities, as an advocate in emergency shelters, in mental health clinics, in domestic violence shelters, and as a case manager in several non profits. i have been on the other side of the line when people call while being suicidal, while being in crisis, while being in danger, when they ask for help.i have gone through countless trainings about suicide prevention, de escalation, crisis management, active listening, assessing and determining care and ultimately how to help someone in the best way i can when they need someone that can listen to them.today, i went to a pawn shop, picked a handgun and put my name down for the wait list for the background check. the clerk said it will be a week for the background check to clear wait times increased since the pandemic started, it was a day or two before that and then i will be able to pick up the handgun and go about my day.it is my first gun, no one seemed concerned about my lack of knowledge about guns, how i was fumbling and shaking while checking the gun out, and how i was so fixated on the wait time and kept asking if there was any way to get it sooner.i have researched on what would be the best way to do this. i have come up with 3 options. 1. opiates i am trying to find a way to get opiates, even though i have never used them, i know a couple people that have overdosed and some of them have come back and said it is quick and painless. if i do not get them by monday i will move on to the next option. 2. hanging i have practiced short suspension, i have tried it and chickened out every single time i start to close my eyes. the moments of consciousness while sitting with the rope on my neck have scared me, but i know how to do it. if the other options do not work out, i will try again.3. gun back home in my country, guns were something i had never touched and only had seen people in the military or in the war use. when i moved to the us i landed in a state that is very passionate about guns, i still refused to touch them. it was not until 2 years ago that i shot my first gun in range, while my whole body was shaking. even though i had been in the hospital for suicidal ideation, a couple months later, my partner became a gun enthusiast and started buying guns. he keeps them in a safe and makes sure i cannot access them, except, when we go shooting together, a few months after the hospital i went from not being able to hear or see guns, to going shooting regularly. i became more comfortable holding them, feeling them, seeing them, using them. my partner saw this as a sign of progress, as a sign of recovery. i see this as progress as well, to take my own life.i have been on and off medications for the last 9 years, anyone with bipolar knows all the cocktails and the back and forth of adjusting, adding, removing, the promises of let us just wait until you are in the right dose,etc.the last cocktail was lithium, lamictal and abilify. right now, we settled on being off lithium after months of begging to be off of it because i was feeling like a zombie and move to prozac and keep the highest dose. of lamictal. well, at this point this is just rambling. but the point of all of this is to say, i know what i am talking about, i know about treatment, i know about prevention and warning signs, i know about safety plans, i know about inpatient, about outpatient, about support networks, and i know how hard it is to care for someone that is depressed and suicidal. i know what we have all been told that should be done.and yet, whatever happens next week, i will either hang myself, overdose or shoot myself in the head. i would planned to drive alone on my birthday, go to ny favorite spot, watch the sunset and pull the trigger, but the wait time for the background check caught me off guard. i will probably do the same if i manage to score the opiates. id rather not to hang myself at home, i have tried and my dogs always lay next to me, and i back out, but it will be the last resort if all else fails.i have not finished writing all the notes for everyone but i will get it done before the weekend ends. i have written a list of what should happen to my belongings, my dogs, my burial, and all the contact information for family, work and friends.i am having a big party on saturday for my birthday and will see almost all my friends. it will be really nice to see everyone before leaving. my partner has said he is burntout, that it is been a year of making sure i keep living, but he is also resentful, that all the effort he is put to make sure i am safe and happy has only given me the freedom to be reckless and self destructive. i know he is tired, but he will not have to deal with me for much longer.after a year of asking people to keep me company, to talk to me and call me when i have been in crisis, a year of asking for help constantly, i think i am done. i have not told anyone about my plans. i have spent my days cleaning and organizing, throwing away things and making sure it will not be so hard to clear out my place after i am gone.so far the only big red flag that shows i will commit suicide is that i was emotionless when i broke the news i would gotten fired from a job i had really wanted and had fought to get, all i said was that it was okay and i knew it was my fault anyways oh well.well, after all this rambling, do you think i am missing something? do you think i should say something else

you just won the grand prize, take it away johnny!ampx200byou will be enjoying your stay at a luxurious jail cell, a room with a view! and if that is not enough, you get an all paid trip to your destination!ampx200bthanks johnny. ampx200balthough, emotional interaction is a bit more complex than that. sometimes it is more about your ability to control undesirable emotions in certain situations. a couple examples i can give you would include laughing at a funeral, falling in love at first sight, getting frustrated when the waiter forgets your water. things of this nature.ampx200bsociety does not ask that you not feel these things. it asks, quite simply, that you do not act on those emotions. how you work out those emotions is of no regard to society, it does not care how you deal, so long that you do deal.ampx200bnext up, we have extravertedness which is your ability to maintain several connections with others, your ability to enjoy the company of several others being in a large group or herd, your ability to rely upon others as well as your ability to allow others to rely upon you.ampx200bfor this example, we will turn to susan. susan is a bit of a homebody and prefers to be at home reading books. however, her new friend is more extraverted and wants to invite susan to her cousin's wedding this next thursday. what should susan do?ampx200ba begrudgingly go to the wedding and hold the action over her friend's head in the futureampx200bb suck it up and go attend the wedding and try to have funampx200bc say she will have a migraine that day and cannot goampx200bif you picked b, congratulations! you have made the right call. this demonstration of willingness to interact just made a wonderful impression on your new friend and now you have got a trauma bond to boot because her sister got too plastered and was puking her guts out and you were there, helping your friend to help her sister into the bathroom stall. you now have a friend for life so long as nothing catastrophic occurs between the two of you. ampx200bnext on the chopping block is conscientiousness. this is the measure of your ability to provide kindness, compassion, sympathy and empathy. your ability to foster a connection with someone and help that connection grow, helping those around you to grow as well as continuing to grow yourself. ampx200bfor this example we turn to our announcer, johhny who is one of the most conscientious people i have known in my life legal disclaimer johnny is not a real person, this is a fictional character. any resemblance to any person living or dead is not intended.ampx200bjohnny is at home, working on the truck when a buddy calls him. his buddy is an alcoholic and is calling because he just slipped and got drunk. what should johnny do?ampx200ba hangs up phone not my damn problem ampx200bampx200bb oh man, what happened? where are you so we can get a cab for youampx200bc i am sorry man, where are you at? i will come pick you up.ampx200bif you picked a, congratulations! your friend was just pronounced dead after stumbling into oncoming traffic because he thought he saw a silver dollar in the middle of the street.ampx200band now we come to the final round of our show, this is it. winner takes all. the ability to believe in the overall good.ampx200bthis is a measure of how you see others. are you able to trust others to be as considerate, conscientious and reliable as yourself? ampx200bfor this example, we will turn to betty. betty has always struggled with believing other people are genuinely good due to several traumatic experiences through her life. though she is trying to get better through therapy. one day, her therapist says something that does not quite sit right with betty's morals, what should betty do?ampx200ba discuss this discomfort in more detail and clarify how it effects her view of her therapist ampx200bb immediately and abruptly get out of her chair and exit the room screaming you are the fing devil!ampx200bc keep her feelings to herself and hold onto that resentment ampx200bif you chose a, congratulations! you have made the right call. sometimes it is hard to believe other people are genuinely good but the true societal test is in being able to establish reason and context as to why you do not trust people but still have the desire to in order to improve your life and the connections you establish. ampx200bwell thank you for tuning in today, i am your host, the abyss, saying have a wonderful day out there and you are beautiful!ampx200bampx200bnow that you have an understanding of what i am talking about, here is my dilemma. i see you, i know what is expected of me. but people keep insisting that i be authentic. be true to myself. ampx200bwhat if i cannot do both of these things simultaneously? what if i have to choose one way or another? would not it just be more beneficial to just obey the rules and hope that one day i will believe it through social reinforcement? or do i keep being who i actually am? this observer, forsaken from society. all alone and cold, only able to see the wonders and treasures of humanity. never to actually take part in those things.ampx200bthis creates a major dilemma inside me. it is not bad enough that i am severely depressed, that i feel utterly worthless, that i have only a few strands of hope left to hold onto. it was not bad enough, i had to know in great detail the reasons why i am not like the rest of you. why i am a monster. ampx200bbut in that knowledge, i also know exactly how to be one of you. but i have to sacrifice my own comfort in this eternal cell to do so. i have to sacrifice myself to become one of you. i cannot keep being pinocchio, nobody wants a hollowed out puppet. i have to be a real boy if i want for real people to accept me.ampx200bthat is my dilemma and i know i am the only one who can make that decision. but what would you do? i have a dilemma 4 core personality",Depression

52681,"breaking up with boyfriend of two years because of my anxiety i 25f have been dating my boyfriend 33m for two years now. we havent really had any problems until my anxiety started worsening about 4 months ago. ive had anxiety and depression since middle school and was officially diagnosed with adhd in january. my anxiety and depression have been at a low for a few years now, which i definitely took for granted. im on a couple different antidepressants and got them to a good level. about 4 months ago, my anxiety started worsening for no discernible reason. okay, great, im working with my therapist on it and talking to my psychiatrist about it, but my overall mental health is still going downhill. my boyfriend, luckily for him, has never struggled with mental health and has no idea how to relate to me or support me. ive been working really hard to communicate with him about how im feeling and what i need, but he really just ignores it. for example, in january we were out of the country for my work and planned on staying a couple extra nights to make a vacation out of it. traveling generally heightens my anxiety, especially international travel. a lot of little things happened including a couple small actions he made one day that led to an anxiety attack, and he basically ignored the fact that it was happening. a couple hours after i came down from the attack and i had taken a cold shower and eaten a little bit, i talked to him about it a bit. i said you can correct me if im wrong, but it seems like you dont know how to respond or support me when im having really bad anxiety moments like this, he said yeah thats true, so i asked if it would be helpful if i told him a couple things that help when im really struggling. he agreed, so i said a few things like getting me some cold water, giving me a hugholding me, taking a walk with me if thats an available option, things like that. he said he could work with that. over the past two or so months since then, ive had a few anxiety attacks similar to the one i had in january, and every time he basically ignores my anxiety. ive repeated my request a couple times, but it doesnt make any difference. there are a lot of other similar issues that have been going on as well. over the weekend, we had a very short conversation probably 5 minutes max and half of it was silence because neither of us knew what to say. none of this is necessarily in order, i really dont remember the order because it was really emotionally charged and kind of upsetting. i said i wanted to try to make it work. i asked him if he wanted to try to make it work, and his response was i want you to be happy, and i dont want to be taking that from you whether its because im not putting the effort in or unable to support you, or something else. which didnt actually answer my question i guess it did in a roundabout way, though. i also asked if he still loved me, and he paused for what felt like forever before saying yes. ive spent more time crying in the past two weeks than i have my entire life before this. ive been thinking about our relationship a lot over the past couple months. hes not a very talkative person in general. if theres an issue, he ignores it completely or makes passive remarks and doesnt actually bring it up. i feel like not only am i the only one that tries to open communication lines, but that im not getting my needs met also. ive talked to my therapist about it a bunch, and i think ive pretty much made my decision im going to break up with him and work on my mental health. it feels terrible sitting on this, knowing the relationship is coming to an end. i have some major events coming up at work this week including a 4 day long audit that im in charge of so im basically trying to balance holding off for as long as possible i.e. the end of the week and being anxious and miserable about it and having that hard conversation now and being a different kind of upset and not able to focus at work. either way, im not going to be able to be completely mentally present at work, im just trying to figure out what would be best for me and also respectful to my partner. im struggling with feeling like im broken and impossible to love because of my anxiety. i know thats not actually the case, but it sure feels that way. anyway, thank you for listening. all my family lives out of state and i only have a couple friends, none of which i really talk about deep stuff like this with. i just want a hug. i apologize for the long post, i just wanted to get it off my chest.",Anxiety

care about. it is too personal, something completely unrelated can happen and trigger me and i switch off completely. i am never going to be able to hold down a job like this. i have got flatmates, but i have just moved in here and i have yet to meet anyone. i keep moving in with groups of strangers. i am living in other people's space. it sounds so stupid but all i want is to live somewhere where i have got my own space in a kitchen cupboard, a shelf in the fridge. not just treading on other people's toes all of the time. most undergraduate students go home for the summer. i am not allowed to call halls home, even though this is the only home i have. i do not have any family, i do not have friends to go and see. this is not the most lonely i have ever been. i spent march 2020 september 2020 living in 1 bed flat, completely alone. i became entirely nocturnal, blew all my savings on a nintendo switch so that i could play animal crossing, listened to discworld audiobooks back to back and walked miles every day so much so that i have irreperably damaged my hip. in that time, i had 5 face to face conversations. and then i left my hometown and moved away to the city i am in now, where i have zero friends, to study. i have gone 512 days without being hugged. i got a hug a couple weeks ago, but it was just a brief thing. nowhere near enough. i think about it every day. i want someone to hold me. properly hold me. tightly. rub my back and hold my hand. i cannot even remember the last time i had physical human contact that was at all satisfying. i pet every cat i meet, i put damp towels in the drier and then stuff them in a hoodie and hold that because the warmth is comforting. but it is nowhere near enough. i have nobody that i can tell that i am struggling, nevermind that i am actively suicidal again. i am nearly 21, i have been trying to end myself since i was 12. i have had people that i could rely on, trust, feel safe with, but for reasons that are rarely anyone's fault, i always end up being left eventually. it is just circumstance. but i miss people so bad. there are 2 groups of people, people i love dearly and who love me equally but being close is not possible and people who are so much more special to me than i have ever been or ever could be to them. my childhood was not horrific. but it did suck. my birthgivers had too many of their own issues. i did not feel safe at home, ever. there was a lot of bad stuff that happened. so i left when i was 18. i have never looked back, never missed them. but from being a teenager i have had to deal with desperately wanting someone to take care of me. i have had to do so much alone. i was left to deal with my own illnesses because no one around me was well enough to. i was bullied everywhere i went and i had to hide it from home because it was too much for anyone to deal with, and my problems caused too much stress and too much stress caused danger for me. i make up stories in my head. of lying on the floor having hurt myself, badly that bits real but then someone walks in and scoops me up and takes me away to a safe place and takes care of me. and i mean that in the most literal way, yeah i want the emotional care, love even, but i would have done anything at 15 for someone to clean my injuries, make me a hot meal, give me a quiet place to rest. i get nightmares. often about things that have happened to me or around me. i wake up on the edge of screaming, often sobbing. right now it is almost every night. sometimes a few times a night. that moment waking up is the most vulnerable i feel these days. everything i want in that moment is impossible. i want to throw myself into someone else's arms. i want protecting. but even if i had a person close by, i know i could never do that. i cannot expect anyone to ever do that for me, it is not fair to do that to anyone. if someone else asked me to do the same, i could not do it. i know i have to fix myself on my own. i have to be able to be kind enough to myself to give myself everything no one else could. but everyone who repeats the the only person you can rely on is yourself thing, always seems to have someone. or at least, has had someone. and yeah, i have had good people. but i always had to go home alone at the end of the day. when i ended up in hospital, i went alone. when i move flats, i have always done that alone. when other people get to ask for help, i have never had that. so now i am just done. i can do everything right, but i cannot do enough for myself. i cannot fix myself. i cannot even fix myself enough that i could ever have a healthy relationship with someone else. i have so much to give, but too much baggage. i wish i could love someone. so this is it forever, until i can make it end. i cannot face being alone anymore",Suicidal

47218,"advice on treatment options? ive been dealing with depression since i was a teenager. i had a suicide attempt in high school, had to be committed to a psychiatric hospital for a couple weeks which was highly traumaticand was on i believe zoloft for a few months until i moved to self medicating with alcohol and realized that the 2 dont mix well. ive seen multiple therapists, but i have a very hard time being honest and open and ive had therapists outright drop me as a client because i wasnt making progress. also when i was drinking heavily it was hard to make appointments so i stopped going. ive come a very long way from this. i very rarely drink now, but i never went back to therapy or medication. i cope by staying extremely busy but i struggle on the weekends when i have less to occupy myself with. i feel like i need something to help. im unsure about meds because even before i could never find a dosage that helped and i dont know if i want to start that process over again. and i also now have a masters in psychology and i have enough insight into myself to be able to understand my behavior. so i dont think a therapist can do anything for me that i cant do for myself, and i doubt that i can be completely open. idk what im looking for, i guess just advice if i should try to get treatment, if it would be worth it.",Depression

19107,"hello, i am 30 and i do not have a life nor prospects for a career. i was depressed due to abusive parents and the great recession. then i failed to find a job that would allow me to support myself after i graduated college at 21. i coasted for a year doing odd jobs and several vacations. soon afterwards i became severely depressed and went catatonic until recently. that is just the background. i was a top 20 student coming out of high school despite already being depressed. although due to self harm as a teenager i have a bad back and knees so cannot do anything where i need to stand or work with my hands. as my mental health continued to decline i had to switch to a humanities major and graduated with a 3.6 gpa. those circumstances combined with mental health issues leads to where i am at today. i actually spent the pandemic trying to go back to school studying computer science, but i am unable to retain any information. i ended up with a 3.2 gpa and i was only taking 2 courses per semester at a relatively easy school.i was and am an attractive person so i had no trouble getting laid while on vacation several years back. my appearance is not the issue, i look almost the same, i have severe mental health issues that prevent me from having log term relationships with anyone let alone a romantic partner. i am not an incel per say, but not having a social life has had a huge impact on my mental health. i strongly suggest to most depressed high school students whose main source of depression is parentalsocial to do whatever it takes to move out after high school.at this point i am extremely insecure, have no self esteem nor self confidence, i am broke and have no friends. i am being evicted me and so after failing to secure gainful employment this summer have decide the objective choice is suicide. i know i am a complete failure, but i do not believe in myself so i have opened the floor to your input. 30 with no life experience or prospects.",Suicidal
15405,"the only reason i am alive right now is because my girlfriend at the time convinced me to speak to a teacher about what i was doing to myself before i was sent to the guidance counselor. it was the worst decision of my entire life. she asked me questions about what i did and kept squirming and making noise when i explained what i had done. she asked me on a scale of 110 how much i wanted to end my life, which i responded with a 5 because i did not care if i lived or died. she called my mom after i begged her not to and told my mom about how smart i was for hiding my injuries and lying about where they came from if someone saw. my mom basically called me an attention whore and told her and my older sister that the only reason i did it was because my friends did it. after school she picked me up and yelled at me and screamed in my face about how i would not be able to go to college and that it was going to go on my record and the entire school was going to know and that the students and teachers were going to gossip about me and not be my friend. she refused to believe i was depressed and kept saying that it was just anxiety. since then i have escaped a toxic relationship, relapsed, got sexually assaulted by my girlfriend, and got suicide baited and harassed for my skin color. if i had just ended my life those 23 years ago, none of this would have happened. i would just be gone and it would actually make me happy. now i am just stuck, depressed and anxious and angry and so worthless and disgusting. i do not want to make it to my 17th birthday. i just want it to end everytime i wonder if it would have been better to end my life when i was in 8th grade",Depression
